{"The Valley of Fear": "\"I am inclined to think--\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I should do so,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.\r\n\r\nI believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but I'll\r\nadmit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.\r\n\r\n\"Really, Holmes,\" said I severely, \"you are a little trying at times.\"\r\n\r\nHe was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate\r\nanswer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted\r\nbreakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had\r\njust drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held it\r\nup to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and the\r\nflap.\r\n\r\n\"It is Porlock's writing,\" said he thoughtfully. \"I can hardly doubt\r\nthat it is Porlock's writing, though I have seen it only twice before.\r\nThe Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive. But if it is\r\nPorlock, then it must be something of the very first importance.\"\r\n\r\nHe was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation\r\ndisappeared in the interest which the words awakened.\r\n\r\n\"Who then is Porlock?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but\r\nbehind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter he\r\nfrankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me ever\r\nto trace him among the teeming millions of this great city. Porlock is\r\nimportant, not for himself, but for the great man with whom he is in\r\ntouch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the shark, the jackal\r\nwith the lion--anything that is insignificant in companionship with\r\nwhat is formidable: not only formidable, Watson, but sinister--in the\r\nhighest degree sinister. That is where he comes within my purview. You\r\nhave heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?\"\r\n\r\n\"The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as--\"\r\n\r\n\"My blushes, Watson!\" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.\r\n\r\n\"I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public.\"\r\n\r\n\"A touch! A distinct touch!\" cried Holmes. \"You are developing a\r\ncertain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must\r\nlearn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are\r\nuttering libel in the eyes of the law--and there lie the glory and the\r\nwonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of every\r\ndeviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain which might\r\nhave made or marred the destiny of nations--that's the man! But so\r\naloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from criticism, so\r\nadmirable in his management and self-effacement, that for those very\r\nwords that you have uttered he could hale you to a court and emerge\r\nwith your year's pension as a solatium for his wounded character. Is he\r\nnot the celebrated author of The Dynamics of an Asteroid, a book which\r\nascends to such rarefied heights of pure mathematics that it is said\r\nthat there was no man in the scientific press capable of criticizing\r\nit? Is this a man to traduce? Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered\r\nprofessor--such would be your respective roles! That's genius, Watson.\r\nBut if I am spared by lesser men, our day will surely come.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I be there to see!\" I exclaimed devoutly. \"But you were speaking\r\nof this man Porlock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes--the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little way\r\nfrom its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound link--between\r\nourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as I have been able\r\nto test it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But no chain is stronger than its weakest link.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock. Led\r\non by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged by the\r\njudicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to him by\r\ndevious methods, he has once or twice given me advance information\r\nwhich has been of value--that highest value which anticipates and\r\nprevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt that, if we had the\r\ncipher, we should find that this communication is of the nature that I\r\nindicate.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose and,\r\nleaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which ran as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n         534 C2    13 127 36 31   4  17   21 41\r\n\r\n           DOUGLAS 109 293  5  37   BIRLSTONE\r\n\r\n             26   BIRLSTONE 9   47     171\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?\"\r\n\r\n\"In this instance, none at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you say 'in this instance'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do\r\nthe apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the\r\nintelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is clearly\r\na reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am told which\r\npage and which book I am powerless.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why 'Douglas' and 'Birlstone'?\"\r\n\r\n\"Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page\r\nin question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why has he not indicated the book?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is\r\nthe delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing\r\ncipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are\r\nundone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it.\r\nOur second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it does not\r\nbring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is more\r\nprobable, the very volume to which these figures refer.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the\r\nappearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were\r\nexpecting.\r\n\r\n\"The same writing,\" remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, \"and\r\nactually signed,\" he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the\r\nepistle. \"Come, we are getting on, Watson.\" His brow clouded, however,\r\nas he glanced over the contents.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our\r\nexpectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come to\r\nno harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"DEAR MR. HOLMES [he says]:\r\n\r\n  \"I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous--he\r\n  suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me\r\n  quite unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope\r\n  with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher.\r\n  I was able to cover it up. If he had seen it, it would have\r\n  gone hard with me. But I read suspicion in his eyes. Please\r\n  burn the cipher message, which can now be of no use to you.\r\n\r\n                                              FRED PORLOCK.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHolmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his\r\nfingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" he said at last, \"there may be nothing in it. It may be\r\nonly his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may\r\nhave read the accusation in the other's eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No less! When any of that party talk about 'He' you know whom they\r\nmean. There is one predominant 'He' for all of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! That's a large question. When you have one of the first brains of\r\nEurope up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back,\r\nthere are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently\r\nscared out of his senses--kindly compare the writing in the note to\r\nthat upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this\r\nill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly legible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case,\r\nand possibly bring trouble on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" said I. \"Of course.\" I had picked up the original cipher\r\nmessage and was bending my brows over it. \"It's pretty maddening to\r\nthink that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper, and\r\nthat it is beyond human power to penetrate it.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the\r\nunsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. \"I\r\nwonder!\" said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. \"Perhaps\r\nthere are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let\r\nus consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man's\r\nreference is to a book. That is our point of departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"A somewhat vague one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon it,\r\nit seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to this\r\nbook?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher message\r\nbegins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a working\r\nhypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the cipher refers.\r\nSo our book has already become a large book which is surely something\r\ngained. What other indications have we as to the nature of this large\r\nbook? The next sign is C2. What do you make of that, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chapter the second, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the\r\npage be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if\r\npage 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first\r\none must have been really intolerable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Column!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not\r\ncolumn, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to\r\nvisualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a\r\nconsiderable length, since one of the words is numbered in the document\r\nas the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the limits of what\r\nreason can supply?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear that we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear\r\nWatson--yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one, he\r\nwould have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before his\r\nplans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says so in\r\nhis note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one which he\r\nthought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He had\r\nit--and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson, it is\r\na very common book.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you say certainly sounds plausible.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed in\r\ndouble columns and in common use.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Bible!\" I cried triumphantly.\r\n\r\n\"Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough! Even\r\nif I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any volume\r\nwhich would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of Moriarty's\r\nassociates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so numerous that he\r\ncould hardly suppose that two copies would have the same pagination.\r\nThis is clearly a book which is standardized. He knows for certain that\r\nhis page 534 will exactly agree with my page 534.\"\r\n\r\n\"But very few books would correspond with that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to\r\nstandardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bradshaw!\"\r\n\r\n\"There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is nervous\r\nand terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly lend itself\r\nto the sending of general messages. We will eliminate Bradshaw. The\r\ndictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same reason. What then is\r\nleft?\"\r\n\r\n\"An almanac!\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched the\r\nspot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's Almanac. It\r\nis in common use. It has the requisite number of pages. It is in double\r\ncolumn. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it becomes, if I\r\nremember right, quite garrulous towards the end.\" He picked the volume\r\nfrom his desk. \"Here is page 534, column two, a substantial block of\r\nprint dealing, I perceive, with the trade and resources of British\r\nIndia. Jot down the words, Watson! Number thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not,\r\nI fear, a very auspicious beginning. Number one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least makes sense, though\r\nsomewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor Moriarty. Now let us try\r\nagain. What does the Mahratta government do? Alas! the next word is\r\n'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good Watson! It is finished!\"\r\n\r\nHe had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy eyebrows\r\nbespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless and unhappy,\r\nstaring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a sudden\r\nexclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which he\r\nemerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!\" he cried. \"We are\r\nbefore our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the seventh of\r\nJanuary, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It is more than\r\nlikely that Porlock took his message from the old one. No doubt he\r\nwould have told us so had his letter of explanation been written. Now\r\nlet us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number thirteen is\r\n'There,' which is much more promising. Number one hundred and\r\ntwenty-seven is 'is'--'There is'\"--Holmes's eyes were gleaming with\r\nexcitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted the\r\nwords--\"'danger.' Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There is\r\ndanger--may--come--very--soon--one.' Then we have the name 'Douglas'--\r\n'rich--country--now--at--Birlstone--House--Birlstone--confidence--is--\r\npressing.' There, Watson! What do you think of pure reason and its\r\nfruit? If the greengrocer had such a thing as a laurel wreath, I\r\nshould send Billy round for it.\"\r\n\r\nI was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he\r\ndeciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.\r\n\r\n\"What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well,\" said Holmes.\r\n\"When you search a single column for words with which to express your\r\nmeaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are\r\nbound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent. The\r\npurport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one\r\nDouglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country\r\ngentleman. He is sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to\r\n'confident'--that it is pressing. There is our result--and a very\r\nworkmanlike little bit of analysis it was!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work,\r\neven as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which he\r\naspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung open\r\nthe door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nThose were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec MacDonald\r\nwas far from having attained the national fame which he has now\r\nachieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective force, who\r\nhad distinguished himself in several cases which had been entrusted to\r\nhim. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional physical\r\nstrength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous eyes spoke no\r\nless clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled out from behind\r\nhis bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with a dour nature and\r\na hard Aberdonian accent.\r\n\r\nTwice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success,\r\nhis own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For this\r\nreason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his amateur\r\ncolleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness with which\r\nhe consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows nothing\r\nhigher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius, and\r\nMacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to\r\nperceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of one\r\nwho already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his\r\nexperience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant of\r\nthe big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\"You are an early bird, Mr. Mac,\" said he. \"I wish you luck with your\r\nworm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth,\r\nI'm thinking, Mr. Holmes,\" the inspector answered, with a knowing grin.\r\n\"Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill. No, I\r\nwon't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way; for the\r\nearly hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows better\r\nthan your own self. But--but--\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of\r\nabsolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon\r\nwhich I had scrawled the enigmatic message.\r\n\r\n\"Douglas!\" he stammered. \"Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man, it's\r\nwitchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you get\r\nthose names?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But\r\nwhy--what's amiss with the names?\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed astonishment.\r\n\"Just this,\" said he, \"that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone Manor House was\r\nhorribly murdered last night!\"\r\n\nIt was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It\r\nwould be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited by\r\nthe amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his\r\nsingular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long\r\nover-stimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual\r\nperceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the\r\nhorror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face\r\nshowed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who\r\nsees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated solution.\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable!\" said he. \"Remarkable!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem surprised.\"\r\n\r\n\"Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be surprised?\r\nI receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which I know to be\r\nimportant, warning me that danger threatens a certain person. Within an\r\nhour I learn that this danger has actually materialized and that the\r\nperson is dead. I am interested; but, as you observe, I am not\r\nsurprised.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts about\r\nthe letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his hands and\r\nhis great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.\r\n\r\n\"I was going down to Birlstone this morning,\" said he. \"I had come to\r\nask you if you cared to come with me--you and your friend here. But\r\nfrom what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather think not,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!\" cried the inspector. \"The papers will be\r\nfull of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the mystery\r\nif there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before ever it\r\noccurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the rest will\r\nfollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the\r\nso-called Porlock?\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. \"Posted\r\nin Camberwell--that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed.\r\nNot much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him\r\nmoney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\"\r\n\r\n\"In notes to Camberwell post-office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that I\r\nwould not try to trace him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think there is someone behind him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know there is.\"\r\n\r\n\"This professor that I've heard you mention?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\"\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced\r\ntowards me. \"I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in the\r\nC. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over this\r\nprofessor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He seems to\r\nbe a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, you can't but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it my\r\nbusiness to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the talk\r\ngot that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern and a\r\nglobe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book; but I\r\ndon't mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had a good\r\nAberdeen upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his thin\r\nface and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put his hand\r\non my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father's blessing\r\nbefore you go out into the cold, cruel world.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. \"Great!\" he said. \"Great! Tell\r\nme, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I\r\nsuppose, in the professor's study?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fine room, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very fine--very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sat in front of his writing desk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my face.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the professor's\r\nhead?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I\r\nsaw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at\r\nyou sideways.\"\r\n\r\n\"That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector endeavoured to look interested.\r\n\r\n\"Jean Baptiste Greuze,\" Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and\r\nleaning well back in his chair, \"was a French artist who flourished\r\nbetween the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working\r\ncareer. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion formed\r\nof him by his contemporaries.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector's eyes grew abstracted. \"Hadn't we better--\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"We are doing so,\" Holmes interrupted. \"All that I am saying has a very\r\ndirect and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone\r\nMystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it.\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. \"Your thoughts\r\nmove a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,\r\nand I can't get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the\r\nconnection between this dead painting man and the affair at Birlstone?\"\r\n\r\n\"All knowledge comes useful to the detective,\" remarked Holmes. \"Even\r\nthe trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled La\r\nJeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand\r\nfrancs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may start\r\na train of reflection in your mind.\"\r\n\r\nIt was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.\r\n\r\n\"I may remind you,\" Holmes continued, \"that the professor's salary can\r\nbe ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is seven\r\nhundred a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how could he buy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so! How could he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's remarkable,\" said the inspector thoughtfully. \"Talk away,\r\nMr. Holmes. I'm just loving it. It's fine!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration--the\r\ncharacteristic of the real artist. \"What about Birlstone?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"We've time yet,\" said the inspector, glancing at his watch. \"I've a\r\ncab at the door, and it won't take us twenty minutes to Victoria. But\r\nabout this picture: I thought you told me once, Mr. Holmes, that you\r\nhad never met Professor Moriarty.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you know about his rooms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's another matter. I have been three times in his rooms, twice\r\nwaiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he came.\r\nOnce--well, I can hardly tell about the once to an official detective.\r\nIt was on the last occasion that I took the liberty of running over his\r\npapers--with the most unexpected results.\"\r\n\r\n\"You found something compromising?\"\r\n\r\n\"Absolutely nothing. That was what amazed me. However, you have now\r\nseen the point of the picture. It shows him to be a very wealthy man.\r\nHow did he acquire wealth? He is unmarried. His younger brother is a\r\nstation master in the west of England. His chair is worth seven hundred\r\na year. And he owns a Greuze.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely the inference is plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an\r\nillegal fashion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Of course I have other reasons for thinking so--dozens of\r\nexiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web\r\nwhere the poisonous, motionless creature is lurking. I only mention the\r\nGreuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own\r\nobservation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, I admit that what you say is interesting: it's more\r\nthan interesting--it's just wonderful. But let us have it a little\r\nclearer if you can. Is it forgery, coining, burglary--where does the\r\nmoney come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever read of Jonathan Wild?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, the name has a familiar sound. Someone in a novel, was he not? I\r\ndon't take much stock of detectives in novels--chaps that do things and\r\nnever let you see how they do them. That's just inspiration: not\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jonathan Wild wasn't a detective, and he wasn't in a novel. He was a\r\nmaster criminal, and he lived last century--1750 or thereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he's no use to me. I'm a practical man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mac, the most practical thing that you ever did in your life would\r\nbe to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a day at\r\nthe annals of crime. Everything comes in circles--even Professor\r\nMoriarty. Jonathan Wild was the hidden force of the London criminals,\r\nto whom he sold his brains and his organization on a fifteen per cent\r\ncommission. The old wheel turns, and the same spoke comes up. It's all\r\nbeen done before, and will be again. I'll tell you one or two things\r\nabout Moriarty which may interest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll interest me, right enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I happen to know who is the first link in his chain--a chain with this\r\nNapoleon-gone-wrong at one end, and a hundred broken fighting men,\r\npickpockets, blackmailers, and card sharpers at the other, with every\r\nsort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel Sebastian\r\nMoran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as himself.\r\nWhat do you think he pays him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Six thousand a year. That's paying for brains, you see--the American\r\nbusiness principle. I learned that detail quite by chance. It's more\r\nthan the Prime Minister gets. That gives you an idea of Moriarty's\r\ngains and of the scale on which he works. Another point: I made it my\r\nbusiness to hunt down some of Moriarty's checks lately--just common\r\ninnocent checks that he pays his household bills with. They were drawn\r\non six different banks. Does that make any impression on your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Queer, certainly! But what do you gather from it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That he wanted no gossip about his wealth. No single man should know\r\nwhat he had. I have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts; the\r\nbulk of his fortune abroad in the Deutsche Bank or the Credit Lyonnais\r\nas likely as not. Sometime when you have a year or two to spare I\r\ncommend to you the study of Professor Moriarty.\"\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald had grown steadily more impressed as the\r\nconversation proceeded. He had lost himself in his interest. Now his\r\npractical Scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the\r\nmatter in hand.\r\n\r\n\"He can keep, anyhow,\" said he. \"You've got us side-tracked with your\r\ninteresting anecdotes, Mr. Holmes. What really counts is your remark\r\nthat there is some connection between the professor and the crime. That\r\nyou get from the warning received through the man Porlock. Can we for\r\nour present practical needs get any further than that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We may form some conception as to the motives of the crime. It is, as\r\nI gather from your original remarks, an inexplicable, or at least an\r\nunexplained, murder. Now, presuming that the source of the crime is as\r\nwe suspect it to be, there might be two different motives. In the first\r\nplace, I may tell you that Moriarty rules with a rod of iron over his\r\npeople. His discipline is tremendous. There is only one punishment in\r\nhis code. It is death. Now we might suppose that this murdered\r\nman--this Douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of the\r\narch-criminal's subordinates--had in some way betrayed the chief. His\r\npunishment followed, and would be known to all--if only to put the fear\r\nof death into them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is one suggestion, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other is that it has been engineered by Moriarty in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business. Was there any robbery?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, it would, of course, be against the first hypothesis and in\r\nfavour of the second. Moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it on\r\na promise of part spoils, or he may have been paid so much down to\r\nmanage it. Either is possible. But whichever it may be, or if it is\r\nsome third combination, it is down at Birlstone that we must seek the\r\nsolution. I know our man too well to suppose that he has left anything\r\nup here which may lead us to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then to Birlstone we must go!\" cried MacDonald, jumping from his\r\nchair. \"My word! it's later than I thought. I can give you, gentlemen,\r\nfive minutes for preparation, and that is all.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ample for us both,\" said Holmes, as he sprang up and hastened to\r\nchange from his dressing gown to his coat. \"While we are on our way,\r\nMr. Mac, I will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All about it\" proved to be disappointingly little, and yet there was\r\nenough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of the\r\nexpert's closest attention. He brightened and rubbed his thin hands\r\ntogether as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details. A long\r\nseries of sterile weeks lay behind us, and here at last there was a\r\nfitting object for those remarkable powers which, like all special\r\ngifts, become irksome to their owner when they are not in use. That\r\nrazor brain blunted and rusted with inaction.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes's eyes glistened, his pale cheeks took a warmer hue,\r\nand his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for\r\nwork reached him. Leaning forward in the cab, he listened intently to\r\nMacDonald's short sketch of the problem which awaited us in Sussex. The\r\ninspector was himself dependent, as he explained to us, upon a\r\nscribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early hours\r\nof the morning. White Mason, the local officer, was a personal friend,\r\nand hence MacDonald had been notified much more promptly than is usual\r\nat Scotland Yard when provincials need their assistance. It is a very\r\ncold scent upon which the Metropolitan expert is generally asked to run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DEAR INSPECTOR MACDONALD [said the letter which he read to us]:\r\n\r\n\"Official requisition for your services is in separate envelope. This\r\nis for your private eye. Wire me what train in the morning you can get\r\nfor Birlstone, and I will meet it--or have it met if I am too\r\noccupied. This case is a snorter. Don't waste a moment in getting\r\nstarted. If you can bring Mr. Holmes, please do so; for he will find\r\nsomething after his own heart. We would think the whole thing had been\r\nfixed up for theatrical effect if there wasn't a dead man in the middle\r\nof it. My word! it is a snorter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Your friend seems to be no fool,\" remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, White Mason is a very live man, if I am any judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, have you anything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that he will give us every detail when we meet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how did you get at Mr. Douglas and the fact that he had been\r\nhorribly murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was in the enclosed official report. It didn't say 'horrible':\r\nthat's not a recognized official term. It gave the name John Douglas.\r\nIt mentioned that his injuries had been in the head, from the discharge\r\nof a shotgun. It also mentioned the hour of the alarm, which was close\r\non to midnight last night. It added that the case was undoubtedly one\r\nof murder, but that no arrest had been made, and that the case was one\r\nwhich presented some very perplexing and extraordinary features. That's\r\nabsolutely all we have at present, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, with your permission, we will leave it at that, Mr. Mac. The\r\ntemptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the\r\nbane of our profession. I can see only two things for certain at\r\npresent--a great brain in London, and a dead man in Sussex. It's the\r\nchain between that we are going to trace.\"\r\n\nNow for a moment I will ask leave to remove my own insignificant\r\npersonality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived\r\nupon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards.\r\nOnly in this way can I make the reader appreciate the people concerned\r\nand the strange setting in which their fate was cast.\r\n\r\nThe village of Birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of\r\nhalf-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of Sussex.\r\nFor centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last few years\r\nits picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a number of\r\nwell-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods around.\r\nThese woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of the great\r\nWeald forest, which thins away until it reaches the northern chalk\r\ndowns. A number of small shops have come into being to meet the wants\r\nof the increased population; so there seems some prospect that\r\nBirlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a modern town. It\r\nis the centre for a considerable area of country, since Tunbridge\r\nWells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or twelve miles to the\r\neastward, over the borders of Kent.\r\n\r\nAbout half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for its\r\nhuge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part of this\r\nvenerable building dates back to the time of the first crusade, when\r\nHugo de Capus built a fortalice in the centre of the estate, which had\r\nbeen granted to him by the Red King. This was destroyed by fire in\r\n1543, and some of its smoke-blackened corner stones were used when, in\r\nJacobean times, a brick country house rose upon the ruins of the feudal\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nThe Manor House, with its many gables and its small diamond-paned\r\nwindows, was still much as the builder had left it in the early\r\nseventeenth century. Of the double moats which had guarded its more\r\nwarlike predecessor, the outer had been allowed to dry up, and served\r\nthe humble function of a kitchen garden. The inner one was still there,\r\nand lay forty feet in breadth, though now only a few feet in depth,\r\nround the whole house. A small stream fed it and continued beyond it,\r\nso that the sheet of water, though turbid, was never ditch-like or\r\nunhealthy. The ground floor windows were within a foot of the surface\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nThe only approach to the house was over a drawbridge, the chains and\r\nwindlass of which had long been rusted and broken. The latest tenants\r\nof the Manor House had, however, with characteristic energy, set this\r\nright, and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised, but\r\nactually was raised every evening and lowered every morning. By thus\r\nrenewing the custom of the old feudal days the Manor House was\r\nconverted into an island during the night--a fact which had a very\r\ndirect bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the attention\r\nof all England.\r\n\r\nThe house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to\r\nmoulder into a picturesque decay when the Douglases took possession of\r\nit. This family consisted of only two individuals--John Douglas and his\r\nwife. Douglas was a remarkable man, both in character and in person. In\r\nage he may have been about fifty, with a strong-jawed, rugged face, a\r\ngrizzling moustache, peculiarly keen gray eyes, and a wiry, vigorous\r\nfigure which had lost nothing of the strength and activity of youth. He\r\nwas cheery and genial to all, but somewhat offhand in his manners,\r\ngiving the impression that he had seen life in social strata on some\r\nfar lower horizon than the county society of Sussex.\r\n\r\nYet, though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more\r\ncultivated neighbours, he soon acquired a great popularity among the\r\nvillagers, subscribing handsomely to all local objects, and attending\r\ntheir smoking concerts and other functions, where, having a remarkably\r\nrich tenor voice, he was always ready to oblige with an excellent song.\r\nHe appeared to have plenty of money, which was said to have been gained\r\nin the California gold fields, and it was clear from his own talk and\r\nthat of his wife that he had spent a part of his life in America.\r\n\r\nThe good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by\r\nhis democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter\r\nindifference to danger. Though a wretched rider, he turned out at every\r\nmeet, and took the most amazing falls in his determination to hold his\r\nown with the best. When the vicarage caught fire he distinguished\r\nhimself also by the fearlessness with which he reentered the building\r\nto save property, after the local fire brigade had given it up as\r\nimpossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas of the Manor House had\r\nwithin five years won himself quite a reputation in Birlstone.\r\n\r\nHis wife, too, was popular with those who had made her acquaintance;\r\nthough, after the English fashion, the callers upon a stranger who\r\nsettled in the county without introductions were few and far between.\r\nThis mattered the less to her, as she was retiring by disposition, and\r\nvery much absorbed, to all appearance, in her husband and her domestic\r\nduties. It was known that she was an English lady who had met Mr.\r\nDouglas in London, he being at that time a widower. She was a beautiful\r\nwoman, tall, dark, and slender, some twenty years younger than her\r\nhusband, a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the contentment of\r\ntheir family life.\r\n\r\nIt was remarked sometimes, however, by those who knew them best, that\r\nthe confidence between the two did not appear to be complete, since the\r\nwife was either very reticent about her husband's past life, or else,\r\nas seemed more likely, was imperfectly informed about it. It had also\r\nbeen noted and commented upon by a few observant people that there were\r\nsigns sometimes of some nerve-strain upon the part of Mrs. Douglas, and\r\nthat she would display acute uneasiness if her absent husband should\r\never be particularly late in his return. On a quiet countryside, where\r\nall gossip is welcome, this weakness of the lady of the Manor House did\r\nnot pass without remark, and it bulked larger upon people's memory when\r\nthe events arose which gave it a very special significance.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was,\r\nit is true, only an intermittent one, but whose presence at the time of\r\nthe strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name\r\nprominently before the public. This was Cecil James Barker, of Hales\r\nLodge, Hampstead.\r\n\r\nCecil Barker's tall, loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the\r\nmain street of Birlstone village; for he was a frequent and welcome\r\nvisitor at the Manor House. He was the more noticed as being the only\r\nfriend of the past unknown life of Mr. Douglas who was ever seen in his\r\nnew English surroundings. Barker was himself an undoubted Englishman;\r\nbut by his remarks it was clear that he had first known Douglas in\r\nAmerica and had there lived on intimate terms with him. He appeared to\r\nbe a man of considerable wealth, and was reputed to be a bachelor.\r\n\r\nIn age he was rather younger than Douglas--forty-five at the most--a\r\ntall, straight, broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved, prize-fighter\r\nface, thick, strong, black eyebrows, and a pair of masterful black eyes\r\nwhich might, even without the aid of his very capable hands, clear a\r\nway for him through a hostile crowd. He neither rode nor shot, but\r\nspent his days in wandering round the old village with his pipe in his\r\nmouth, or in driving with his host, or in his absence with his hostess,\r\nover the beautiful countryside. \"An easy-going, free-handed gentleman,\"\r\nsaid Ames, the butler. \"But, my word! I had rather not be the man that\r\ncrossed him!\" He was cordial and intimate with Douglas, and he was no\r\nless friendly with his wife--a friendship which more than once seemed\r\nto cause some irritation to the husband, so that even the servants were\r\nable to perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one\r\nof the family when the catastrophe occurred.\r\n\r\nAs to the other denizens of the old building, it will suffice out of a\r\nlarge household to mention the prim, respectable, and capable Ames, and\r\nMrs. Allen, a buxom and cheerful person, who relieved the lady of some\r\nof her household cares. The other six servants in the house bear no\r\nrelation to the events of the night of January 6th.\r\n\r\nIt was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small\r\nlocal police station, in charge of Sergeant Wilson of the Sussex\r\nConstabulary. Cecil Barker, much excited, had rushed up to the door and\r\npealed furiously upon the bell. A terrible tragedy had occurred at the\r\nManor House, and John Douglas had been murdered. That was the\r\nbreathless burden of his message. He had hurried back to the house,\r\nfollowed within a few minutes by the police sergeant, who arrived at\r\nthe scene of the crime a little after twelve o'clock, after taking\r\nprompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious was\r\nafoot.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the Manor House, the sergeant had found the drawbridge\r\ndown, the windows lighted up, and the whole household in a state of\r\nwild confusion and alarm. The white-faced servants were huddling\r\ntogether in the hall, with the frightened butler wringing his hands in\r\nthe doorway. Only Cecil Barker seemed to be master of himself and his\r\nemotions; he had opened the door which was nearest to the entrance and\r\nhe had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him. At that moment there\r\narrived Dr. Wood, a brisk and capable general practitioner from the\r\nvillage. The three men entered the fatal room together, while the\r\nhorror-stricken butler followed at their heels, closing the door behind\r\nhim to shut out the terrible scene from the maid servants.\r\n\r\nThe dead man lay on his back, sprawling with outstretched limbs in the\r\ncentre of the room. He was clad only in a pink dressing gown, which\r\ncovered his night clothes. There were carpet slippers on his bare feet.\r\nThe doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp which had stood\r\non the table. One glance at the victim was enough to show the healer\r\nthat his presence could be dispensed with. The man had been horribly\r\ninjured. Lying across his chest was a curious weapon, a shotgun with\r\nthe barrel sawed off a foot in front of the triggers. It was clear that\r\nthis had been fired at close range and that he had received the whole\r\ncharge in the face, blowing his head almost to pieces. The triggers had\r\nbeen wired together, so as to make the simultaneous discharge more\r\ndestructive.\r\n\r\nThe country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous\r\nresponsibility which had come so suddenly upon him. \"We will touch\r\nnothing until my superiors arrive,\" he said in a hushed voice, staring\r\nin horror at the dreadful head.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing has been touched up to now,\" said Cecil Barker. \"I'll answer\r\nfor that. You see it all exactly as I found it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When was that?\" The sergeant had drawn out his notebook.\r\n\r\n\"It was just half-past eleven. I had not begun to undress, and I was\r\nsitting by the fire in my bedroom when I heard the report. It was not\r\nvery loud--it seemed to be muffled. I rushed down--I don't suppose it\r\nwas thirty seconds before I was in the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the door open?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was open. Poor Douglas was lying as you see him. His bedroom\r\ncandle was burning on the table. It was I who lit the lamp some minutes\r\nafterward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see no one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I heard Mrs. Douglas coming down the stair behind me, and I rushed\r\nout to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight. Mrs. Allen, the\r\nhousekeeper, came and took her away. Ames had arrived, and we ran back\r\ninto the room once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely I have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was up until I lowered it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how could any murderer have got away? It is out of the question!\r\nMr. Douglas must have shot himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was our first idea. But see!\" Barker drew aside the curtain, and\r\nshowed that the long, diamond-paned window was open to its full extent.\r\n\"And look at this!\" He held the lamp down and illuminated a smudge of\r\nblood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill. \"Someone has\r\nstood there in getting out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that someone waded across the moat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime, he\r\nmust have been in the water at that very moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not a doubt of it. I wish to heaven that I had rushed to the\r\nwindow! But the curtain screened it, as you can see, and so it never\r\noccurred to me. Then I heard the step of Mrs. Douglas, and I could not\r\nlet her enter the room. It would have been too horrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horrible enough!\" said the doctor, looking at the shattered head and\r\nthe terrible marks which surrounded it. \"I've never seen such injuries\r\nsince the Birlstone railway smash.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, I say,\" remarked the police sergeant, whose slow, bucolic common\r\nsense was still pondering the open window. \"It's all very well your\r\nsaying that a man escaped by wading this moat, but what I ask you is,\r\nhow did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's the question,\" said Barker.\r\n\r\n\"At what o'clock was it raised?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was nearly six o'clock,\" said Ames, the butler.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard,\" said the sergeant, \"that it was usually raised at sunset.\r\nThat would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of year.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Douglas had visitors to tea,\" said Ames. \"I couldn't raise it\r\nuntil they went. Then I wound it up myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it comes to this,\" said the sergeant: \"If anyone came from\r\noutside--if they did--they must have got in across the bridge before\r\nsix and been in hiding ever since, until Mr. Douglas came into the room\r\nafter eleven.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so! Mr. Douglas went round the house every night the last\r\nthing before he turned in to see that the lights were right. That\r\nbrought him in here. The man was waiting and shot him. Then he got away\r\nthrough the window and left his gun behind him. That's how I read it;\r\nfor nothing else will fit the facts.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the\r\nfloor. The initials V. V. and under them the number 341 were rudely\r\nscrawled in ink upon it.\r\n\r\n\"What's this?\" he asked, holding it up.\r\n\r\nBarker looked at it with curiosity. \"I never noticed it before,\" he\r\nsaid. \"The murderer must have left it behind him.\"\r\n\r\n\"V. V.--341. I can make no sense of that.\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers. \"What's V. V.?\r\nSomebody's initials, maybe. What have you got there, Dr. Wood?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front of\r\nthe fireplace--a substantial, workmanlike hammer. Cecil Barker pointed\r\nto a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Douglas was altering the pictures yesterday,\" he said. \"I saw him\r\nmyself, standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above it.\r\nThat accounts for the hammer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd best put it back on the rug where we found it,\" said the\r\nsergeant, scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity. \"It will want\r\nthe best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing. It\r\nwill be a London job before it is finished.\" He raised the hand lamp\r\nand walked slowly round the room. \"Hullo!\" he cried, excitedly, drawing\r\nthe window curtain to one side. \"What o'clock were those curtains\r\ndrawn?\"\r\n\r\n\"When the lamps were lit,\" said the butler. \"It would be shortly after\r\nfour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone had been hiding here, sure enough.\" He held down the light,\r\nand the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner. \"I'm\r\nbound to say this bears out your theory, Mr. Barker. It looks as if the\r\nman got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn and\r\nbefore six when the bridge was raised. He slipped into this room,\r\nbecause it was the first that he saw. There was no other place where he\r\ncould hide, so he popped in behind this curtain. That all seems clear\r\nenough. It is likely that his main idea was to burgle the house; but\r\nMr. Douglas chanced to come upon him, so he murdered him and escaped.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's how I read it,\" said Barker. \"But, I say, aren't we wasting\r\nprecious time? Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the\r\nfellow gets away?\"\r\n\r\nThe sergeant considered for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"There are no trains before six in the morning; so he can't get away by\r\nrail. If he goes by road with his legs all dripping, it's odds that\r\nsomeone will notice him. Anyhow, I can't leave here myself until I am\r\nrelieved. But I think none of you should go until we see more clearly\r\nhow we all stand.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body.\r\n\"What's this mark?\" he asked. \"Could this have any connection with the\r\ncrime?\"\r\n\r\nThe dead man's right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown, and\r\nexposed as high as the elbow. About halfway up the forearm was a\r\ncurious brown design, a triangle inside a circle, standing out in vivid\r\nrelief upon the lard-coloured skin.\r\n\r\n\"It's not tattooed,\" said the doctor, peering through his glasses. \"I\r\nnever saw anything like it. The man has been branded at some time as\r\nthey brand cattle. What is the meaning of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't profess to know the meaning of it,\" said Cecil Barker; \"but I\r\nhave seen the mark on Douglas many times this last ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so have I,\" said the butler. \"Many a time when the master has\r\nrolled up his sleeves I have noticed that very mark. I've often\r\nwondered what it could be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it has nothing to do with the crime, anyhow,\" said the sergeant.\r\n\"But it's a rum thing all the same. Everything about this case is rum.\r\nWell, what is it now?\"\r\n\r\nThe butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing at\r\nthe dead man's outstretched hand.\r\n\r\n\"They've taken his wedding ring!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"What!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed. Master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the\r\nlittle finger of his left hand. That ring with the rough nugget on it\r\nwas above it, and the twisted snake ring on the third finger. There's\r\nthe nugget and there's the snake, but the wedding ring is gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's right,\" said Barker.\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me,\" said the sergeant, \"that the wedding ring was below\r\nthe other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the murderer, or whoever it was, first took off this ring you\r\ncall the nugget ring, then the wedding ring, and afterwards put the\r\nnugget ring back again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so!\"\r\n\r\nThe worthy country policeman shook his head. \"Seems to me the sooner we\r\nget London on to this case the better,\" said he. \"White Mason is a\r\nsmart man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It\r\nwon't be long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we'll have\r\nto look to London before we are through. Anyhow, I'm not ashamed to say\r\nthat it is a deal too thick for the likes of me.\"\r\n\nAt three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the urgent\r\ncall from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from headquarters in a\r\nlight dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the five-forty train in\r\nthe morning he had sent his message to Scotland Yard, and he was at the\r\nBirlstone station at twelve o'clock to welcome us. White Mason was a\r\nquiet, comfortable-looking person in a loose tweed suit, with a\r\nclean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body, and powerful bandy legs\r\nadorned with gaiters, looking like a small farmer, a retired\r\ngamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very favourable specimen of\r\nthe provincial criminal officer.\r\n\r\n\"A real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!\" he kept repeating. \"We'll\r\nhave the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I'm hoping\r\nwe will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it\r\nand messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that I\r\ncan remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr.\r\nHolmes, or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos\r\nwill have a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the Westville\r\nArms. There's no other place; but I hear that it is clean and good. The\r\nman will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In ten\r\nminutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated in\r\nthe parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of those\r\nevents which have been outlined in the previous chapter. MacDonald made\r\nan occasional note, while Holmes sat absorbed, with the expression of\r\nsurprised and reverent admiration with which the botanist surveys the\r\nrare and precious bloom.\r\n\r\n\"Remarkable!\" he said, when the story was unfolded, \"most remarkable! I\r\ncan hardly recall any case where the features have been more peculiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes,\" said White Mason in great\r\ndelight. \"We're well up with the times in Sussex. I've told you now how\r\nmatters were, up to the time when I took over from Sergeant Wilson\r\nbetween three and four this morning. My word! I made the old mare go!\r\nBut I need not have been in such a hurry, as it turned out; for there\r\nwas nothing immediate that I could do. Sergeant Wilson had all the\r\nfacts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a few of my\r\nown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were they?\" asked Holmes eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I first had the hammer examined. There was Dr. Wood there to\r\nhelp me. We found no signs of violence upon it. I was hoping that if\r\nMr. Douglas defended himself with the hammer, he might have left his\r\nmark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat. But there was\r\nno stain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, of course, proves nothing at all,\" remarked Inspector MacDonald.\r\n\"There has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the hammer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. It doesn't prove it wasn't used. But there might have been\r\nstains, and that would have helped us. As a matter of fact there were\r\nnone. Then I examined the gun. They were buckshot cartridges, and, as\r\nSergeant Wilson pointed out, the triggers were wired together so that,\r\nif you pulled on the hinder one, both barrels were discharged. Whoever\r\nfixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take no chances\r\nof missing his man. The sawed gun was not more than two foot long--one\r\ncould carry it easily under one's coat. There was no complete maker's\r\nname; but the printed letters P-E-N were on the fluting between the\r\nbarrels, and the rest of the name had been cut off by the saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"A big P with a flourish above it, E and N smaller?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pennsylvania Small Arms Company--well-known American firm,\" said\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\nWhite Mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner looks\r\nat the Harley Street specialist who by a word can solve the\r\ndifficulties that perplex him.\r\n\r\n\"That is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful!\r\nWonderful! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world in\r\nyour memory?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes dismissed the subject with a wave.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it is an American shotgun,\" White Mason continued. \"I seem to\r\nhave read that a sawed-off shotgun is a weapon used in some parts of\r\nAmerica. Apart from the name upon the barrel, the idea had occurred to\r\nme. There is some evidence then, that this man who entered the house\r\nand killed its master was an American.\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald shook his head. \"Man, you are surely travelling overfast,\"\r\nsaid he. \"I have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in\r\nthe house at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"The open window, the blood on the sill, the queer card, the marks of\r\nboots in the corner, the gun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing there that could not have been arranged. Mr. Douglas was an\r\nAmerican, or had lived long in America. So had Mr. Barker. You don't\r\nneed to import an American from outside in order to account for\r\nAmerican doings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ames, the butler--\"\r\n\r\n\"What about him? Is he reliable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ten years with Sir Charles Chandos--as solid as a rock. He has been\r\nwith Douglas ever since he took the Manor House five years ago. He has\r\nnever seen a gun of this sort in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gun was made to conceal. That's why the barrels were sawed. It\r\nwould fit into any box. How could he swear there was no such gun in the\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, anyhow, he had never seen one.\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald shook his obstinate Scotch head. \"I'm not convinced yet that\r\nthere was ever anyone in the house,\" said he. \"I'm asking you to\r\nconseedar\" (his accent became more Aberdonian as he lost himself in his\r\nargument) \"I'm asking you to conseedar what it involves if you suppose\r\nthat this gun was ever brought into the house, and that all these\r\nstrange things were done by a person from outside. Oh, man, it's just\r\ninconceivable! It's clean against common sense! I put it to you, Mr.\r\nHolmes, judging it by what we have heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, state your case, Mr. Mac,\" said Holmes in his most judicial\r\nstyle.\r\n\r\n\"The man is not a burglar, supposing that he ever existed. The ring\r\nbusiness and the card point to premeditated murder for some private\r\nreason. Very good. Here is a man who slips into a house with the\r\ndeliberate intention of committing murder. He knows, if he knows\r\nanything, that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape, as the\r\nhouse is surrounded with water. What weapon would he choose? You would\r\nsay the most silent in the world. Then he could hope when the deed was\r\ndone to slip quickly from the window, to wade the moat, and to get away\r\nat his leisure. That's understandable. But is it understandable that he\r\nshould go out of his way to bring with him the most noisy weapon he\r\ncould select, knowing well that it will fetch every human being in the\r\nhouse to the spot as quick as they can run, and that it is all odds\r\nthat he will be seen before he can get across the moat? Is that\r\ncredible, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you put the case strongly,\" my friend replied thoughtfully. \"It\r\ncertainly needs a good deal of justification. May I ask, Mr. White\r\nMason, whether you examined the farther side of the moat at once to see\r\nif there were any signs of the man having climbed out from the water?\"\r\n\r\n\"There were no signs, Mr. Holmes. But it is a stone ledge, and one\r\ncould hardly expect them.\"\r\n\r\n\"No tracks or marks?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Would there be any objection, Mr. White Mason, to our going down\r\nto the house at once? There may possibly be some small point which\r\nmight be suggestive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was going to propose it, Mr. Holmes; but I thought it well to put\r\nyou in touch with all the facts before we go. I suppose if anything\r\nshould strike you--\" White Mason looked doubtfully at the amateur.\r\n\r\n\"I have worked with Mr. Holmes before,\" said Inspector MacDonald. \"He\r\nplays the game.\"\r\n\r\n\"My own idea of the game, at any rate,\" said Holmes, with a smile. \"I\r\ngo into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the police.\r\nIf I have ever separated myself from the official force, it is because\r\nthey have first separated themselves from me. I have no wish ever to\r\nscore at their expense. At the same time, Mr. White Mason, I claim the\r\nright to work in my own way and give my results at my own\r\ntime--complete rather than in stages.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we\r\nknow,\" said White Mason cordially. \"Come along, Dr. Watson, and when\r\nthe time comes we'll all hope for a place in your book.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms\r\non each side of it. Just beyond were two ancient stone pillars,\r\nweather-stained and lichen-blotched bearing upon their summits a\r\nshapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of Capus of\r\nBirlstone. A short walk along the winding drive with such sward and\r\noaks around it as one only sees in rural England, then a sudden turn,\r\nand the long, low Jacobean house of dingy, liver-coloured brick lay\r\nbefore us, with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of it.\r\nAs we approached it, there was the wooden drawbridge and the beautiful\r\nbroad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the cold, winter\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nThree centuries had flowed past the old Manor House, centuries of\r\nbirths and of homecomings, of country dances and of the meetings of fox\r\nhunters. Strange that now in its old age this dark business should have\r\ncast its shadow upon the venerable walls! And yet those strange, peaked\r\nroofs and quaint, overhung gables were a fitting covering to grim and\r\nterrible intrigue. As I looked at the deep-set windows and the long\r\nsweep of the dull-coloured, water-lapped front, I felt that no more\r\nfitting scene could be set for such a tragedy.\r\n\r\n\"That's the window,\" said White Mason, \"that one on the immediate right\r\nof the drawbridge. It's open just as it was found last night.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks rather narrow for a man to pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it wasn't a fat man, anyhow. We don't need your deductions, Mr.\r\nHolmes, to tell us that. But you or I could squeeze through all right.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across. Then he\r\nexamined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it.\r\n\r\n\"I've had a good look, Mr. Holmes,\" said White Mason. \"There is nothing\r\nthere, no sign that anyone has landed--but why should he leave any\r\nsign?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Why should he? Is the water always turbid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Generally about this colour. The stream brings down the clay.\"\r\n\r\n\"How deep is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"About two feet at each side and three in the middle.\"\r\n\r\n\"So we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in\r\ncrossing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, a child could not be drowned in it.\"\r\n\r\nWe walked across the drawbridge, and were admitted by a quaint,\r\ngnarled, dried-up person, who was the butler, Ames. The poor old fellow\r\nwas white and quivering from the shock. The village sergeant, a tall,\r\nformal, melancholy man, still held his vigil in the room of Fate. The\r\ndoctor had departed.\r\n\r\n\"Anything fresh, Sergeant Wilson?\" asked White Mason.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you can go home. You've had enough. We can send for you if we\r\nwant you. The butler had better wait outside. Tell him to warn Mr.\r\nCecil Barker, Mrs. Douglas, and the housekeeper that we may want a word\r\nwith them presently. Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will allow me to give\r\nyou the views I have formed first, and then you will be able to arrive\r\nat your own.\"\r\n\r\nHe impressed me, this country specialist. He had a solid grip of fact\r\nand a cool, clear, common-sense brain, which should take him some way\r\nin his profession. Holmes listened to him intently, with no sign of\r\nthat impatience which the official exponent too often produced.\r\n\r\n\"Is it suicide, or is it murder--that's our first question, gentlemen,\r\nis it not? If it were suicide, then we have to believe that this man\r\nbegan by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it; that he then\r\ncame down here in his dressing gown, trampled mud into a corner behind\r\nthe curtain in order to give the idea someone had waited for him,\r\nopened the window, put blood on the--\"\r\n\r\n\"We can surely dismiss that,\" said MacDonald.\r\n\r\n\"So I think. Suicide is out of the question. Then a murder has been\r\ndone. What we have to determine is, whether it was done by someone\r\noutside or inside the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, let's hear the argument.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are considerable difficulties both ways, and yet one or the\r\nother it must be. We will suppose first that some person or persons\r\ninside the house did the crime. They got this man down here at a time\r\nwhen everything was still and yet no one was asleep. They then did the\r\ndeed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to tell\r\neveryone what had happened--a weapon that was never seen in the house\r\nbefore. That does not seem a very likely start, does it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it does not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a\r\nminute at the most had passed before the whole household--not Mr. Cecil\r\nBarker alone, though he claims to have been the first, but Ames and all\r\nof them were on the spot. Do you tell me that in that time the guilty\r\nperson managed to make footmarks in the corner, open the window, mark\r\nthe sill with blood, take the wedding ring off the dead man's finger,\r\nand all the rest of it? It's impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"You put it very clearly,\" said Holmes. \"I am inclined to agree with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we are driven back to the theory that it was done by\r\nsomeone from outside. We are still faced with some big difficulties;\r\nbut anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities. The man got into the\r\nhouse between four-thirty and six; that is to say, between dusk and the\r\ntime when the bridge was raised. There had been some visitors, and the\r\ndoor was open; so there was nothing to prevent him. He may have been a\r\ncommon burglar, or he may have had some private grudge against Mr.\r\nDouglas. Since Mr. Douglas has spent most of his life in America, and\r\nthis shotgun seems to be an American weapon, it would seem that the\r\nprivate grudge is the more likely theory. He slipped into this room\r\nbecause it was the first he came to, and he hid behind the curtain.\r\nThere he remained until past eleven at night. At that time Mr. Douglas\r\nentered the room. It was a short interview, if there were any interview\r\nat all; for Mrs. Douglas declares that her husband had not left her\r\nmore than a few minutes when she heard the shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"The candle shows that,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. The candle, which was a new one, is not burned more than half\r\nan inch. He must have placed it on the table before he was attacked;\r\notherwise, of course, it would have fallen when he fell. This shows\r\nthat he was not attacked the instant that he entered the room. When Mr.\r\nBarker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was out.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all clear enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, we can reconstruct things on those lines. Mr. Douglas\r\nenters the room. He puts down the candle. A man appears from behind the\r\ncurtain. He is armed with this gun. He demands the wedding ring--Heaven\r\nonly knows why, but so it must have been. Mr. Douglas gave it up. Then\r\neither in cold blood or in the course of a struggle--Douglas may have\r\ngripped the hammer that was found upon the mat--he shot Douglas in this\r\nhorrible way. He dropped his gun and also it would seem this queer\r\ncard--V. V. 341, whatever that may mean--and he made his escape through\r\nthe window and across the moat at the very moment when Cecil Barker was\r\ndiscovering the crime. How's that, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very interesting, but just a little unconvincing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, it would be absolute nonsense if it wasn't that anything else is\r\neven worse!\" cried MacDonald. \"Somebody killed the man, and whoever it\r\nwas I could clearly prove to you that he should have done it some other\r\nway. What does he mean by allowing his retreat to be cut off like that?\r\nWhat does he mean by using a shotgun when silence was his one chance of\r\nescape? Come, Mr. Holmes, it's up to you to give us a lead, since you\r\nsay Mr. White Mason's theory is unconvincing.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion, missing\r\nno word that was said, with his keen eyes darting to right and to left,\r\nand his forehead wrinkled with speculation.\r\n\r\n\"I should like a few more facts before I get so far as a theory, Mr.\r\nMac,\" said he, kneeling down beside the body. \"Dear me! these injuries\r\nare really appalling. Can we have the butler in for a moment? . . .\r\nAmes, I understand that you have often seen this very unusual mark--a\r\nbranded triangle inside a circle--upon Mr. Douglas's forearm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Frequently, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never heard any speculation as to what it meant?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have caused great pain when it was inflicted. It is\r\nundoubtedly a burn. Now, I observe, Ames, that there is a small piece\r\nof plaster at the angle of Mr. Douglas's jaw. Did you observe that in\r\nlife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for a very long time, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suggestive!\" said Holmes. \"It may, of course, be a mere coincidence,\r\nor it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had\r\nreason to apprehend danger. Had you noticed anything unusual in his\r\nconduct, yesterday, Ames?\"\r\n\r\n\"It struck me that he was a little restless and excited, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! The attack may not have been entirely unexpected. We do seem to\r\nmake a little progress, do we not? Perhaps you would rather do the\r\nquestioning, Mr. Mac?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, it's in better hands than mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, we will pass to this card--V. V. 341. It is rough\r\ncardboard. Have you any of the sort in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each\r\nbottle on to the blotting paper. \"It was not printed in this room,\" he\r\nsaid; \"this is black ink and the other purplish. It was done by a thick\r\npen, and these are fine. No, it was done elsewhere, I should say. Can\r\nyou make anything of the inscription, Ames?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think, Mr. Mac?\"\r\n\r\n\"It gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort; the same\r\nwith his badge upon the forearm.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's my idea, too,\" said White Mason.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far our\r\ndifficulties disappear. An agent from such a society makes his way into\r\nthe house, waits for Mr. Douglas, blows his head nearly off with this\r\nweapon, and escapes by wading the moat, after leaving a card beside the\r\ndead man, which will when mentioned in the papers, tell other members\r\nof the society that vengeance has been done. That all hangs together.\r\nBut why this gun, of all weapons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why the missing ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why no arrest? It's past two now. I take it for granted that since\r\ndawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out for a wet\r\nstranger?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready,\r\nthey can hardly miss him. And yet they have missed him up to now!\"\r\nHolmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the blood\r\nmark on the sill. \"It is clearly the tread of a shoe. It is remarkably\r\nbroad; a splay-foot, one would say. Curious, because, so far as one can\r\ntrace any footmark in this mud-stained corner, one would say it was a\r\nmore shapely sole. However, they are certainly very indistinct. What's\r\nthis under the side table?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Douglas's dumb-bells,\" said Ames.\r\n\r\n\"Dumb-bell--there's only one. Where's the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, Mr. Holmes. There may have been only one. I have not\r\nnoticed them for months.\"\r\n\r\n\"One dumb-bell--\" Holmes said seriously; but his remarks were\r\ninterrupted by a sharp knock at the door.\r\n\r\nA tall, sunburned, capable-looking, clean-shaved man looked in at us. I\r\nhad no difficulty in guessing that it was the Cecil Barker of whom I\r\nhad heard. His masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning\r\nglance from face to face.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt your consultation,\" said he, \"but you should hear\r\nthe latest news.\"\r\n\r\n\"An arrest?\"\r\n\r\n\"No such luck. But they've found his bicycle. The fellow left his\r\nbicycle behind him. Come and have a look. It is within a hundred yards\r\nof the hall door.\"\r\n\r\nWe found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive\r\ninspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of\r\nevergreens in which it had been concealed. It was a well used\r\nRudge-Whitworth, splashed as from a considerable journey. There was a\r\nsaddlebag with spanner and oilcan, but no clue as to the owner.\r\n\r\n\"It would be a grand help to the police,\" said the inspector, \"if these\r\nthings were numbered and registered. But we must be thankful for what\r\nwe've got. If we can't find where he went to, at least we are likely to\r\nget where he came from. But what in the name of all that is wonderful\r\nmade the fellow leave it behind? And how in the world has he got away\r\nwithout it? We don't seem to get a gleam of light in the case, Mr.\r\nHolmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't we?\" my friend answered thoughtfully. \"I wonder!\"\r\n\n\"Have you seen all you want of the study?\" asked White Mason as we\r\nreentered the house.\r\n\r\n\"For the time,\" said the inspector, and Holmes nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the\r\npeople in the house. We could use the dining-room, Ames. Please come\r\nyourself first and tell us what you know.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler's account was a simple and a clear one, and he gave a\r\nconvincing impression of sincerity. He had been engaged five years\r\nbefore, when Douglas first came to Birlstone. He understood that Mr.\r\nDouglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in America. He had\r\nbeen a kind and considerate employer--not quite what Ames was used to,\r\nperhaps; but one can't have everything. He never saw any signs of\r\napprehension in Mr. Douglas: on the contrary, he was the most fearless\r\nman he had ever known. He ordered the drawbridge to be pulled up every\r\nnight because it was the ancient custom of the old house, and he liked\r\nto keep the old ways up.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglas seldom went to London or left the village; but on the day\r\nbefore the crime he had been shopping at Tunbridge Wells. He (Ames) had\r\nobserved some restlessness and excitement on the part of Mr. Douglas\r\nthat day; for he had seemed impatient and irritable, which was unusual\r\nwith him. He had not gone to bed that night; but was in the pantry at\r\nthe back of the house, putting away the silver, when he heard the bell\r\nring violently. He heard no shot; but it was hardly possible he would,\r\nas the pantry and kitchens were at the very back of the house and there\r\nwere several closed doors and a long passage between. The housekeeper\r\nhad come out of her room, attracted by the violent ringing of the bell.\r\nThey had gone to the front of the house together.\r\n\r\nAs they reached the bottom of the stair he had seen Mrs. Douglas coming\r\ndown it. No, she was not hurrying; it did not seem to him that she was\r\nparticularly agitated. Just as she reached the bottom of the stair Mr.\r\nBarker had rushed out of the study. He had stopped Mrs. Douglas and\r\nbegged her to go back.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, go back to your room!\" he cried. \"Poor Jack is dead!\r\nYou can do nothing. For God's sake, go back!\"\r\n\r\nAfter some persuasion upon the stairs Mrs. Douglas had gone back. She\r\ndid not scream. She made no outcry whatever. Mrs. Allen, the\r\nhousekeeper, had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the bedroom.\r\nAmes and Mr. Barker had then returned to the study, where they had\r\nfound everything exactly as the police had seen it. The candle was not\r\nlit at that time; but the lamp was burning. They had looked out of the\r\nwindow; but the night was very dark and nothing could be seen or heard.\r\nThey had then rushed out into the hall, where Ames had turned the\r\nwindlass which lowered the drawbridge. Mr. Barker had then hurried off\r\nto get the police.\r\n\r\nSuch, in its essentials, was the evidence of the butler.\r\n\r\nThe account of Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, was, so far as it went, a\r\ncorroboration of that of her fellow servant. The housekeeper's room was\r\nrather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which Ames\r\nhad been working. She was preparing to go to bed when the loud ringing\r\nof the bell had attracted her attention. She was a little hard of\r\nhearing. Perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot; but in any\r\ncase the study was a long way off. She remembered hearing some sound\r\nwhich she imagined to be the slamming of a door. That was a good deal\r\nearlier--half an hour at least before the ringing of the bell. When Mr.\r\nAmes ran to the front she went with him. She saw Mr. Barker, very pale\r\nand excited, come out of the study. He intercepted Mrs. Douglas, who\r\nwas coming down the stairs. He entreated her to go back, and she\r\nanswered him, but what she said could not be heard.\r\n\r\n\"Take her up! Stay with her!\" he had said to Mrs. Allen.\r\n\r\nShe had therefore taken her to the bedroom, and endeavoured to soothe\r\nher. She was greatly excited, trembling all over, but made no other\r\nattempt to go downstairs. She just sat in her dressing gown by her\r\nbedroom fire, with her head sunk in her hands. Mrs. Allen stayed with\r\nher most of the night. As to the other servants, they had all gone to\r\nbed, and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police\r\narrived. They slept at the extreme back of the house, and could not\r\npossibly have heard anything.\r\n\r\nSo far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save\r\nlamentations and expressions of amazement.\r\n\r\nCecil Barker succeeded Mrs. Allen as a witness. As to the occurrences\r\nof the night before, he had very little to add to what he had already\r\ntold the police. Personally, he was convinced that the murderer had\r\nescaped by the window. The bloodstain was conclusive, in his opinion,\r\non that point. Besides, as the bridge was up, there was no other\r\npossible way of escaping. He could not explain what had become of the\r\nassassin or why he had not taken his bicycle, if it were indeed his. He\r\ncould not possibly have been drowned in the moat, which was at no place\r\nmore than three feet deep.\r\n\r\nIn his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder. Douglas\r\nwas a reticent man, and there were some chapters in his life of which\r\nhe never spoke. He had emigrated to America when he was a very young\r\nman. He had prospered well, and Barker had first met him in California,\r\nwhere they had become partners in a successful mining claim at a place\r\ncalled Benito Canyon. They had done very well; but Douglas had suddenly\r\nsold out and started for England. He was a widower at that time. Barker\r\nhad afterwards realized his money and come to live in London. Thus they\r\nhad renewed their friendship.\r\n\r\nDouglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging over\r\nhis head, and he had always looked upon his sudden departure from\r\nCalifornia, and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in\r\nEngland, as being connected with this peril. He imagined that some\r\nsecret society, some implacable organization, was on Douglas's track,\r\nwhich would never rest until it killed him. Some remarks of his had\r\ngiven him this idea; though he had never told him what the society was,\r\nnor how he had come to offend it. He could only suppose that the legend\r\nupon the placard had some reference to this secret society.\r\n\r\n\"How long were you with Douglas in California?\" asked Inspector\r\nMacDonald.\r\n\r\n\"Five years altogether.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a bachelor, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"A widower.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever heard where his first wife came from?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I remember his saying that she was of German extraction, and I\r\nhave seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of\r\ntyphoid the year before I met him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't associate his past with any particular part of America?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard him talk of Chicago. He knew that city well and had\r\nworked there. I have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts. He\r\nhad travelled a good deal in his time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was he a politician? Had this secret society to do with politics?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he cared nothing about politics.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have no reason to think it was criminal?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I never met a straighter man in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was there anything curious about his life in California?\"\r\n\r\n\"He liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains. He\r\nwould never go where other men were if he could help it. That's why I\r\nfirst thought that someone was after him. Then when he left so suddenly\r\nfor Europe I made sure that it was so. I believe that he had a warning\r\nof some sort. Within a week of his leaving half a dozen men were\r\ninquiring for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of men?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they were a mighty hard-looking crowd. They came up to the claim\r\nand wanted to know where he was. I told them that he was gone to Europe\r\nand that I did not know where to find him. They meant him no good--it\r\nwas easy to see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were these men Americans--Californians?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know about Californians. They were Americans, all right.\r\nBut they were not miners. I don't know what they were, and was very\r\nglad to see their backs.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was six years ago?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nearer seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you were together five years in California, so that this\r\nbusiness dates back not less than eleven years at the least?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such\r\nearnestness for as long as that. It would be no light thing that would\r\ngive rise to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it shadowed his whole life. It was never quite out of his\r\nmind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if a man had a danger hanging over him, and knew what it was,\r\ndon't you think he would turn to the police for protection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against.\r\nThere's one thing you should know. He always went about armed. His\r\nrevolver was never out of his pocket. But, by bad luck, he was in his\r\ndressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night. Once the\r\nbridge was up, I guess he thought he was safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like these dates a little clearer,\" said MacDonald. \"It is\r\nquite six years since Douglas left California. You followed him next\r\nyear, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he had been married five years. You must have returned about the\r\ntime of his marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"About a month before. I was his best man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know Mrs. Douglas before her marriage?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I did not. I had been away from England for ten years.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have seen a good deal of her since.\"\r\n\r\nBarker looked sternly at the detective. \"I have seen a good deal of him\r\nsince,\" he answered. \"If I have seen her, it is because you cannot\r\nvisit a man without knowing his wife. If you imagine there is any\r\nconnection--\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine nothing, Mr. Barker. I am bound to make every inquiry which\r\ncan bear upon the case. But I mean no offense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some inquiries are offensive,\" Barker answered angrily.\r\n\r\n\"It's only the facts that we want. It is in your interest and\r\neveryone's interest that they should be cleared up. Did Mr. Douglas\r\nentirely approve your friendship with his wife?\"\r\n\r\nBarker grew paler, and his great, strong hands were clasped\r\nconvulsively together. \"You have no right to ask such questions!\" he\r\ncried. \"What has this to do with the matter you are investigating?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must repeat the question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I refuse to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can refuse to answer; but you must be aware that your refusal is\r\nin itself an answer, for you would not refuse if you had not something\r\nto conceal.\"\r\n\r\nBarker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong black\r\neyebrows drawn low in intense thought. Then he looked up with a smile.\r\n\"Well, I guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty after all,\r\nand I have no right to stand in the way of it. I'd only ask you not to\r\nworry Mrs. Douglas over this matter; for she has enough upon her just\r\nnow. I may tell you that poor Douglas had just one fault in the world,\r\nand that was his jealousy. He was fond of me--no man could be fonder of\r\na friend. And he was devoted to his wife. He loved me to come here, and\r\nwas forever sending for me. And yet if his wife and I talked together\r\nor there seemed any sympathy between us, a kind of wave of jealousy\r\nwould pass over him, and he would be off the handle and saying the\r\nwildest things in a moment. More than once I've sworn off coming for\r\nthat reason, and then he would write me such penitent, imploring\r\nletters that I just had to. But you can take it from me, gentlemen, if\r\nit was my last word, that no man ever had a more loving, faithful\r\nwife--and I can say also no friend could be more loyal than I!\"\r\n\r\nIt was spoken with fervour and feeling, and yet Inspector MacDonald\r\ncould not dismiss the subject.\r\n\r\n\"You are aware,\" said he, \"that the dead man's wedding ring has been\r\ntaken from his finger?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it appears,\" said Barker.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by 'appears'? You know it as a fact.\"\r\n\r\nThe man seemed confused and undecided. \"When I said 'appears' I meant\r\nthat it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mere fact that the ring should be absent, whoever may have removed\r\nit, would suggest to anyone's mind, would it not, that the marriage and\r\nthe tragedy were connected?\"\r\n\r\nBarker shrugged his broad shoulders. \"I can't profess to say what it\r\nmeans.\" he answered. \"But if you mean to hint that it could reflect in\r\nany way upon this lady's honour\"--his eyes blazed for an instant, and\r\nthen with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own emotions--\"well,\r\nyou are on the wrong track, that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I've anything else to ask you at present,\" said\r\nMacDonald, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"There was one small point,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes. \"When you\r\nentered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table, was\r\nthere not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was so.\"\r\n\r\n\"By its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You at once rang for help?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it arrived very speedily?\"\r\n\r\n\"Within a minute or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and that\r\nthe lamp had been lighted. That seems very remarkable.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Barker showed some signs of indecision. \"I don't see that it was\r\nremarkable, Mr. Holmes,\" he answered after a pause. \"The candle threw a\r\nvery bad light. My first thought was to get a better one. The lamp was\r\non the table; so I lit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And blew out the candle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes asked no further question, and Barker, with a deliberate look\r\nfrom one to the other of us, which had, as it seemed to me, something\r\nof defiance in it, turned and left the room.\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would wait\r\nupon Mrs. Douglas in her room; but she had replied that she would meet\r\nus in the dining room. She entered now, a tall and beautiful woman of\r\nthirty, reserved and self-possessed to a remarkable degree, very\r\ndifferent from the tragic and distracted figure I had pictured. It is\r\ntrue that her face was pale and drawn, like that of one who has endured\r\na great shock; but her manner was composed, and the finely moulded hand\r\nwhich she rested upon the edge of the table was as steady as my own.\r\nHer sad, appealing eyes travelled from one to the other of us with a\r\ncuriously inquisitive expression. That questioning gaze transformed\r\nitself suddenly into abrupt speech.\r\n\r\n\"Have you found anything out yet?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nWas it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than\r\nof hope in the question?\r\n\r\n\"We have taken every possible step, Mrs. Douglas,\" said the inspector.\r\n\"You may rest assured that nothing will be neglected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spare no money,\" she said in a dead, even tone. \"It is my desire that\r\nevery possible effort should be made.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear not; but all I know is at your service.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have heard from Mr. Cecil Barker that you did not actually\r\nsee--that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he turned me back upon the stairs. He begged me to return to my\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. You had heard the shot, and you had at once come down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I put on my dressing gown and then came down.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the\r\nstair by Mr. Barker?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may have been a couple of minutes. It is so hard to reckon time at\r\nsuch a moment. He implored me not to go on. He assured me that I could\r\ndo nothing. Then Mrs. Allen, the housekeeper, led me upstairs again. It\r\nwas all like some dreadful dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs\r\nbefore you heard the shot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I cannot say. He went from his dressing room, and I did not hear\r\nhim go. He did the round of the house every night, for he was nervous\r\nof fire. It is the only thing that I have ever known him nervous of.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just the point which I want to come to, Mrs. Douglas. You have\r\nknown your husband only in England, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have been married five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in America and\r\nmight bring some danger upon him?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas thought earnestly before she answered. \"Yes.\" she said at\r\nlast, \"I have always felt that there was a danger hanging over him. He\r\nrefused to discuss it with me. It was not from want of confidence in\r\nme--there was the most complete love and confidence between us--but it\r\nwas out of his desire to keep all alarm away from me. He thought I\r\nshould brood over it if I knew all, and so he was silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know it, then?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas's face lit with a quick smile. \"Can a husband ever carry\r\nabout a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no suspicion\r\nof it? I knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes in his\r\nAmerican life. I knew it by certain precautions he took. I knew it by\r\ncertain words he let fall. I knew it by the way he looked at unexpected\r\nstrangers. I was perfectly certain that he had some powerful enemies,\r\nthat he believed they were on his track, and that he was always on his\r\nguard against them. I was so sure of it that for years I have been\r\nterrified if ever he came home later than was expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I ask,\" asked Holmes, \"what the words were which attracted your\r\nattention?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Valley of Fear,\" the lady answered. \"That was an expression he has\r\nused when I questioned him. 'I have been in the Valley of Fear. I am\r\nnot out of it yet.'--'Are we never to get out of the Valley of Fear?' I\r\nhave asked him when I have seen him more serious than usual. 'Sometimes\r\nI think that we never shall,' he has answered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you asked him what he meant by the Valley of Fear?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did; but his face would become very grave and he would shake his\r\nhead. 'It is bad enough that one of us should have been in its shadow,'\r\nhe said. 'Please God it shall never fall upon you!' It was some real\r\nvalley in which he had lived and in which something terrible had\r\noccurred to him, of that I am certain; but I can tell you no more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he never mentioned any names?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting accident\r\nthree years ago. Then I remember that there was a name that came\r\ncontinually to his lips. He spoke it with anger and a sort of horror.\r\nMcGinty was the name--Bodymaster McGinty. I asked him when he recovered\r\nwho Bodymaster McGinty was, and whose body he was master of. 'Never of\r\nmine, thank God!' he answered with a laugh, and that was all I could\r\nget from him. But there is a connection between Bodymaster McGinty and\r\nthe Valley of Fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one other point,\" said Inspector MacDonald. \"You met Mr.\r\nDouglas in a boarding house in London, did you not, and became engaged\r\nto him there? Was there any romance, anything secret or mysterious,\r\nabout the wedding?\"\r\n\r\n\"There was romance. There is always romance. There was nothing\r\nmysterious.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had no rival?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I was quite free.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have heard, no doubt, that his wedding ring has been taken. Does\r\nthat suggest anything to you? Suppose that some enemy of his old life\r\nhad tracked him down and committed this crime, what possible reason\r\ncould he have for taking his wedding ring?\"\r\n\r\nFor an instant I could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile\r\nflickered over the woman's lips.\r\n\r\n\"I really cannot tell,\" she answered. \"It is certainly a most\r\nextraordinary thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we will not detain you any longer, and we are sorry to have put\r\nyou to this trouble at such a time,\" said the inspector. \"There are\r\nsome other points, no doubt; but we can refer to you as they arise.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose, and I was again conscious of that quick, questioning glance\r\nwith which she had just surveyed us. \"What impression has my evidence\r\nmade upon you?\" The question might as well have been spoken. Then, with\r\na bow, she swept from the room.\r\n\r\n\"She's a beautiful woman--a very beautiful woman,\" said MacDonald\r\nthoughtfully, after the door had closed behind her. \"This man Barker\r\nhas certainly been down here a good deal. He is a man who might be\r\nattractive to a woman. He admits that the dead man was jealous, and\r\nmaybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy. Then there's\r\nthat wedding ring. You can't get past that. The man who tears a wedding\r\nring off a dead man's--What do you say to it, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\nMy friend had sat with his head upon his hands, sunk in the deepest\r\nthought. Now he rose and rang the bell. \"Ames,\" he said, when the\r\nbutler entered, \"where is Mr. Cecil Barker now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe came back in a moment to say that Barker was in the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Can you remember, Ames, what Mr. Barker had on his feet last night\r\nwhen you joined him in the study?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Holmes. He had a pair of bedroom slippers. I brought him his\r\nboots when he went for the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are the slippers now?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are still under the chair in the hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Ames. It is, of course, important for us to know which\r\ntracks may be Mr. Barker's and which from outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I may say that I noticed that the slippers were stained with\r\nblood--so indeed were my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is natural enough, considering the condition of the room. Very\r\ngood, Ames. We will ring if we want you.\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we were in the study. Holmes had brought with him\r\nthe carpet slippers from the hall. As Ames had observed, the soles of\r\nboth were dark with blood.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" murmured Holmes, as he stood in the light of the window and\r\nexamined them minutely. \"Very strange indeed!\"\r\n\r\nStooping with one of his quick feline pounces, he placed the slipper\r\nupon the blood mark on the sill. It exactly corresponded. He smiled in\r\nsilence at his colleagues.\r\n\r\nThe inspector was transfigured with excitement. His native accent\r\nrattled like a stick upon railings.\r\n\r\n\"Man,\" he cried, \"there's not a doubt of it! Barker has just marked the\r\nwindow himself. It's a good deal broader than any bootmark. I mind that\r\nyou said it was a splay-foot, and here's the explanation. But what's\r\nthe game, Mr. Holmes--what's the game?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, what's the game?\" my friend repeated thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nWhite Mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his\r\nprofessional satisfaction. \"I said it was a snorter!\" he cried. \"And a\r\nreal snorter it is!\"\r\n\nThe three detectives had many matters of detail into which to inquire;\r\nso I returned alone to our modest quarters at the village inn. But\r\nbefore doing so I took a stroll in the curious old-world garden which\r\nflanked the house. Rows of very ancient yew trees cut into strange\r\ndesigns girded it round. Inside was a beautiful stretch of lawn with an\r\nold sundial in the middle, the whole effect so soothing and restful\r\nthat it was welcome to my somewhat jangled nerves.\r\n\r\nIn that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget, or remember only\r\nas some fantastic nightmare, that darkened study with the sprawling,\r\nbloodstained figure on the floor. And yet, as I strolled round it and\r\ntried to steep my soul in its gentle balm, a strange incident occurred,\r\nwhich brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister impression in\r\nmy mind.\r\n\r\nI have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden. At the\r\nend farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge. On\r\nthe other side of this hedge, concealed from the eyes of anyone\r\napproaching from the direction of the house, there was a stone seat. As\r\nI approached the spot I was aware of voices, some remark in the deep\r\ntones of a man, answered by a little ripple of feminine laughter.\r\n\r\nAn instant later I had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes lit\r\nupon Mrs. Douglas and the man Barker before they were aware of my\r\npresence. Her appearance gave me a shock. In the dining-room she had\r\nbeen demure and discreet. Now all pretense of grief had passed away\r\nfrom her. Her eyes shone with the joy of living, and her face still\r\nquivered with amusement at some remark of her companion. He sat\r\nforward, his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees, with an\r\nanswering smile upon his bold, handsome face. In an instant--but it was\r\njust one instant too late--they resumed their solemn masks as my figure\r\ncame into view. A hurried word or two passed between them, and then\r\nBarker rose and came towards me.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said he, \"but am I addressing Dr. Watson?\"\r\n\r\nI bowed with a coldness which showed, I dare say, very plainly the\r\nimpression which had been produced upon my mind.\r\n\r\n\"We thought that it was probably you, as your friendship with Mr.\r\nSherlock Holmes is so well known. Would you mind coming over and\r\nspeaking to Mrs. Douglas for one instant?\"\r\n\r\nI followed him with a dour face. Very clearly I could see in my mind's\r\neye that shattered figure on the floor. Here within a few hours of the\r\ntragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing together behind a\r\nbush in the garden which had been his. I greeted the lady with reserve.\r\nI had grieved with her grief in the dining-room. Now I met her\r\nappealing gaze with an unresponsive eye.\r\n\r\n\"I fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted.\" said she.\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"It is no business of mine,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps some day you will do me justice. If you only realized--\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize,\" said Barker quickly.\r\n\"As he has himself said, it is no possible business of his.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said I, \"and so I will beg leave to resume my walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment, Dr. Watson,\" cried the woman in a pleading voice. \"There\r\nis one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone\r\nelse in the world, and it may make a very great difference to me. You\r\nknow Mr. Holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone\r\nelse can. Supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his\r\nknowledge, is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to the\r\ndetectives?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said Barker eagerly. \"Is he on his own or is he\r\nentirely in with them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know that I should be justified in discussing such a\r\npoint.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg--I implore that you will, Dr. Watson! I assure you that you will\r\nbe helping us--helping me greatly if you will guide us on that point.\"\r\n\r\nThere was such a ring of sincerity in the woman's voice that for the\r\ninstant I forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her will.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes is an independent investigator,\" I said. \"He is his own\r\nmaster, and would act as his own judgment directed. At the same time,\r\nhe would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were working\r\non the same case, and he would not conceal from them anything which\r\nwould help them in bringing a criminal to justice. Beyond this I can\r\nsay nothing, and I would refer you to Mr. Holmes himself if you wanted\r\nfuller information.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying I raised my hat and went upon my way, leaving them still\r\nseated behind that concealing hedge. I looked back as I rounded the far\r\nend of it, and saw that they were still talking very earnestly\r\ntogether, and, as they were gazing after me, it was clear that it was\r\nour interview that was the subject of their debate.\r\n\r\n\"I wish none of their confidences,\" said Holmes, when I reported to him\r\nwhat had occurred. He had spent the whole afternoon at the Manor House\r\nin consultation with his two colleagues, and returned about five with a\r\nravenous appetite for a high tea which I had ordered for him. \"No\r\nconfidences, Watson; for they are mighty awkward if it comes to an\r\narrest for conspiracy and murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it will come to that?\"\r\n\r\nHe was in his most cheerful and debonair humour. \"My dear Watson, when\r\nI have exterminated that fourth egg I shall be ready to put you in\r\ntouch with the whole situation. I don't say that we have fathomed\r\nit--far from it--but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell--\"\r\n\r\n\"The dumb-bell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Watson, is it possible that you have not penetrated the fact\r\nthat the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell? Well, well, you need\r\nnot be downcast; for between ourselves I don't think that either\r\nInspector Mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the\r\noverwhelming importance of this incident. One dumb-bell, Watson!\r\nConsider an athlete with one dumb-bell! Picture to yourself the\r\nunilateral development, the imminent danger of a spinal curvature.\r\nShocking, Watson, shocking!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with\r\nmischief, watching my intellectual entanglement. The mere sight of his\r\nexcellent appetite was an assurance of success, for I had very clear\r\nrecollections of days and nights without a thought of food, when his\r\nbaffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin, eager\r\nfeatures became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete mental\r\nconcentration. Finally he lit his pipe, and sitting in the inglenook of\r\nthe old village inn he talked slowly and at random about his case,\r\nrather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a considered\r\nstatement.\r\n\r\n\"A lie, Watson--a great, big, thumping, obtrusive, uncompromising\r\nlie--that's what meets us on the threshold! There is our starting\r\npoint. The whole story told by Barker is a lie. But Barker's story is\r\ncorroborated by Mrs. Douglas. Therefore she is lying also. They are\r\nboth lying, and in a conspiracy. So now we have the clear problem. Why\r\nare they lying, and what is the truth which they are trying so hard to\r\nconceal? Let us try, Watson, you and I, if we can get behind the lie\r\nand reconstruct the truth.\r\n\r\n\"How do I know that they are lying? Because it is a clumsy fabrication\r\nwhich simply could not be true. Consider! According to the story given\r\nto us, the assassin had less than a minute after the murder had been\r\ncommitted to take that ring, which was under another ring, from the\r\ndead man's finger, to replace the other ring--a thing which he would\r\nsurely never have done--and to put that singular card beside his\r\nvictim. I say that this was obviously impossible.\r\n\r\n\"You may argue--but I have too much respect for your judgment, Watson,\r\nto think that you will do so--that the ring may have been taken before\r\nthe man was killed. The fact that the candle had been lit only a short\r\ntime shows that there had been no lengthy interview. Was Douglas, from\r\nwhat we hear of his fearless character, a man who would be likely to\r\ngive up his wedding ring at such short notice, or could we conceive of\r\nhis giving it up at all? No, no, Watson, the assassin was alone with\r\nthe dead man for some time with the lamp lit. Of that I have no doubt\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\"But the gunshot was apparently the cause of death. Therefore the shot\r\nmust have been fired some time earlier than we are told. But there\r\ncould be no mistake about such a matter as that. We are in the\r\npresence, therefore, of a deliberate conspiracy upon the part of the\r\ntwo people who heard the gunshot--of the man Barker and of the woman\r\nDouglas. When on the top of this I am able to show that the blood mark\r\non the windowsill was deliberately placed there by Barker, in order to\r\ngive a false clue to the police, you will admit that the case grows\r\ndark against him.\r\n\r\n\"Now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did\r\noccur. Up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house; so\r\nit was certainly not before that time. At a quarter to eleven they had\r\nall gone to their rooms with the exception of Ames, who was in the\r\npantry. I have been trying some experiments after you left us this\r\nafternoon, and I find that no noise which MacDonald can make in the\r\nstudy can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all shut.\r\n\r\n\"It is otherwise, however, from the housekeeper's room. It is not so\r\nfar down the corridor, and from it I could vaguely hear a voice when it\r\nwas very loudly raised. The sound from a shotgun is to some extent\r\nmuffled when the discharge is at very close range, as it undoubtedly\r\nwas in this instance. It would not be very loud, and yet in the silence\r\nof the night it should have easily penetrated to Mrs. Allen's room. She\r\nis, as she has told us, somewhat deaf; but none the less she mentioned\r\nin her evidence that she did hear something like a door slamming half\r\nan hour before the alarm was given. Half an hour before the alarm was\r\ngiven would be a quarter to eleven. I have no doubt that what she heard\r\nwas the report of the gun, and that this was the real instant of the\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n\"If this is so, we have now to determine what Barker and Mrs. Douglas,\r\npresuming that they are not the actual murderers, could have been doing\r\nfrom quarter to eleven, when the sound of the shot brought them down,\r\nuntil quarter past eleven, when they rang the bell and summoned the\r\nservants. What were they doing, and why did they not instantly give the\r\nalarm? That is the question which faces us, and when it has been\r\nanswered we shall surely have gone some way to solve our problem.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced myself,\" said I, \"that there is an understanding\r\nbetween those two people. She must be a heartless creature to sit\r\nlaughing at some jest within a few hours of her husband's murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. She does not shine as a wife even in her own account of what\r\noccurred. I am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind, as you are\r\naware, Watson, but my experience of life has taught me that there are\r\nfew wives, having any regard for their husbands, who would let any\r\nman's spoken word stand between them and that husband's dead body.\r\nShould I ever marry, Watson, I should hope to inspire my wife with some\r\nfeeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a housekeeper\r\nwhen my corpse was lying within a few yards of her. It was badly\r\nstage-managed; for even the rawest investigators must be struck by the\r\nabsence of the usual feminine ululation. If there had been nothing\r\nelse, this incident alone would have suggested a prearranged conspiracy\r\nto my mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think then, definitely, that Barker and Mrs. Douglas are guilty of\r\nthe murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an appalling directness about your questions, Watson,\" said\r\nHolmes, shaking his pipe at me. \"They come at me like bullets. If you\r\nput it that Mrs. Douglas and Barker know the truth about the murder,\r\nand are conspiring to conceal it, then I can give you a whole-souled\r\nanswer. I am sure they do. But your more deadly proposition is not so\r\nclear. Let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"We will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty\r\nlove, and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands\r\nbetween them. It is a large supposition; for discreet inquiry among\r\nservants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way. On the\r\ncontrary, there is a good deal of evidence that the Douglases were very\r\nattached to each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, I am sure, cannot be true.\" said I, thinking of the beautiful\r\nsmiling face in the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Well at least they gave that impression. However, we will suppose that\r\nthey are an extraordinarily astute couple, who deceive everyone upon\r\nthis point, and conspire to murder the husband. He happens to be a man\r\nover whose head some danger hangs--\"\r\n\r\n\"We have only their word for that.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes looked thoughtful. \"I see, Watson. You are sketching out a\r\ntheory by which everything they say from the beginning is false.\r\nAccording to your idea, there was never any hidden menace, or secret\r\nsociety, or Valley of Fear, or Boss MacSomebody, or anything else.\r\nWell, that is a good sweeping generalization. Let us see what that\r\nbrings us to. They invent this theory to account for the crime. They\r\nthen play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof\r\nof the existence of some outsider. The stain on the windowsill conveys\r\nthe same idea. So does the card on the body, which might have been\r\nprepared in the house. That all fits into your hypothesis, Watson. But\r\nnow we come on the nasty, angular, uncompromising bits which won't slip\r\ninto their places. Why a cut-off shotgun of all weapons--and an\r\nAmerican one at that? How could they be so sure that the sound of it\r\nwould not bring someone on to them? It's a mere chance as it is that\r\nMrs. Allen did not start out to inquire for the slamming door. Why did\r\nyour guilty couple do all this, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess that I can't explain it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then again, if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband, are\r\nthey going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing his\r\nwedding ring after his death? Does that strike you as very probable,\r\nWatson?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it does not.\"\r\n\r\n\"And once again, if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed outside\r\nhad occurred to you, would it really have seemed worth doing when the\r\ndullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious blind, as the\r\nbicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in order to make\r\nhis escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can conceive of no explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit of\r\nman cannot conceive an explanation. Simply as a mental exercise,\r\nwithout any assertion that it is true, let me indicate a possible line\r\nof thought. It is, I admit, mere imagination; but how often is\r\nimagination the mother of truth?\r\n\r\n\"We will suppose that there was a guilty secret, a really shameful\r\nsecret in the life of this man Douglas. This leads to his murder by\r\nsomeone who is, we will suppose, an avenger, someone from outside. This\r\navenger, for some reason which I confess I am still at a loss to\r\nexplain, took the dead man's wedding ring. The vendetta might\r\nconceivably date back to the man's first marriage, and the ring be\r\ntaken for some such reason.\r\n\r\n\"Before this avenger got away, Barker and the wife had reached the\r\nroom. The assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him would\r\nlead to the publication of some hideous scandal. They were converted to\r\nthis idea, and preferred to let him go. For this purpose they probably\r\nlowered the bridge, which can be done quite noiselessly, and then\r\nraised it again. He made his escape, and for some reason thought that\r\nhe could do so more safely on foot than on the bicycle. He therefore\r\nleft his machine where it would not be discovered until he had got\r\nsafely away. So far we are within the bounds of possibility, are we\r\nnot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is possible, no doubt,\" said I, with some reserve.\r\n\r\n\"We have to remember, Watson, that whatever occurred is certainly\r\nsomething very extraordinary. Well, now, to continue our supposititious\r\ncase, the couple--not necessarily a guilty couple--realize after the\r\nmurderer is gone that they have placed themselves in a position in\r\nwhich it may be difficult for them to prove that they did not\r\nthemselves either do the deed or connive at it. They rapidly and rather\r\nclumsily met the situation. The mark was put by Barker's bloodstained\r\nslipper upon the window-sill to suggest how the fugitive got away. They\r\nobviously were the two who must have heard the sound of the gun; so\r\nthey gave the alarm exactly as they would have done, but a good half\r\nhour after the event.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you propose to prove all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if there were an outsider, he may be traced and taken. That\r\nwould be the most effective of all proofs. But if not--well, the\r\nresources of science are far from being exhausted. I think that an\r\nevening alone in that study would help me much.\"\r\n\r\n\"An evening alone!\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose to go up there presently. I have arranged it with the\r\nestimable Ames, who is by no means whole-hearted about Barker. I shall\r\nsit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me inspiration. I'm a\r\nbeliever in the genius loci. You smile, Friend Watson. Well, we shall\r\nsee. By the way, you have that big umbrella of yours, have you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll borrow that if I may.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly--but what a wretched weapon! If there is danger--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing serious, my dear Watson, or I should certainly ask for your\r\nassistance. But I'll take the umbrella. At present I am only awaiting\r\nthe return of our colleagues from Tunbridge Wells, where they are at\r\npresent engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nightfall before Inspector MacDonald and White Mason came back\r\nfrom their expedition, and they arrived exultant, reporting a great\r\nadvance in our investigation.\r\n\r\n\"Man, I'll admeet that I had my doubts if there was ever an outsider,\"\r\nsaid MacDonald, \"but that's all past now. We've had the bicycle\r\nidentified, and we have a description of our man; so that's a long step\r\non our journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounds to me like the beginning of the end,\" said Holmes. \"I'm sure\r\nI congratulate you both with all my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I started from the fact that Mr. Douglas had seemed disturbed\r\nsince the day before, when he had been at Tunbridge Wells. It was at\r\nTunbridge Wells then that he had become conscious of some danger. It\r\nwas clear, therefore, that if a man had come over with a bicycle it was\r\nfrom Tunbridge Wells that he might be expected to have come. We took\r\nthe bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels. It was identified\r\nat once by the manager of the Eagle Commercial as belonging to a man\r\nnamed Hargrave, who had taken a room there two days before. This\r\nbicycle and a small valise were his whole belongings. He had registered\r\nhis name as coming from London, but had given no address. The valise\r\nwas London made, and the contents were British; but the man himself was\r\nundoubtedly an American.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Holmes gleefully, \"you have indeed done some solid\r\nwork while I have been sitting spinning theories with my friend! It's a\r\nlesson in being practical, Mr. Mac.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it's just that, Mr. Holmes,\" said the inspector with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"But this may all fit in with your theories,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"That may or may not be. But let us hear the end, Mr. Mac. Was there\r\nnothing to identify this man?\"\r\n\r\n\"So little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself\r\nagainst identification. There were no papers or letters, and no marking\r\nupon the clothes. A cycle map of the county lay on his bedroom table.\r\nHe had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday morning on his bicycle,\r\nand no more was heard of him until our inquiries.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what puzzles me, Mr. Holmes,\" said White Mason. \"If the fellow\r\ndid not want the hue and cry raised over him, one would imagine that he\r\nwould have returned and remained at the hotel as an inoffensive\r\ntourist. As it is, he must know that he will be reported to the police\r\nby the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be connected with\r\nthe murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"So one would imagine. Still, he has been justified of his wisdom up to\r\ndate, at any rate, since he has not been taken. But his\r\ndescription--what of that?\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald referred to his notebook. \"Here we have it so far as they\r\ncould give it. They don't seem to have taken any very particular stock\r\nof him; but still the porter, the clerk, and the chambermaid are all\r\nagreed that this about covers the points. He was a man about five foot\r\nnine in height, fifty or so years of age, his hair slightly grizzled, a\r\ngrayish moustache, a curved nose, and a face which all of them\r\ndescribed as fierce and forbidding.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, bar the expression, that might almost be a description of\r\nDouglas himself,\" said Holmes. \"He is just over fifty, with grizzled\r\nhair and moustache, and about the same height. Did you get anything\r\nelse?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket, and he wore\r\na short yellow overcoat and a soft cap.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the shotgun?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is less than two feet long. It could very well have fitted into his\r\nvalise. He could have carried it inside his overcoat without\r\ndifficulty.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes,\" said MacDonald, \"when we have got our man--and you\r\nmay be sure that I had his description on the wires within five minutes\r\nof hearing it--we shall be better able to judge. But, even as it\r\nstands, we have surely gone a long way. We know that an American\r\ncalling himself Hargrave came to Tunbridge Wells two days ago with\r\nbicycle and valise. In the latter was a sawed-off shotgun; so he came\r\nwith the deliberate purpose of crime. Yesterday morning he set off for\r\nthis place on his bicycle, with his gun concealed in his overcoat. No\r\none saw him arrive, so far as we can learn; but he need not pass\r\nthrough the village to reach the park gates, and there are many\r\ncyclists upon the road. Presumably he at once concealed his cycle among\r\nthe laurels where it was found, and possibly lurked there himself, with\r\nhis eye on the house, waiting for Mr. Douglas to come out. The shotgun\r\nis a strange weapon to use inside a house; but he had intended to use\r\nit outside, and there it has very obvious advantages, as it would be\r\nimpossible to miss with it, and the sound of shots is so common in an\r\nEnglish sporting neighbourhood that no particular notice would be\r\ntaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all very clear,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Douglas did not appear. What was he to do next? He left his\r\nbicycle and approached the house in the twilight. He found the bridge\r\ndown and no one about. He took his chance, intending, no doubt, to make\r\nsome excuse if he met anyone. He met no one. He slipped into the first\r\nroom that he saw, and concealed himself behind the curtain. Thence he\r\ncould see the drawbridge go up, and he knew that his only escape was\r\nthrough the moat. He waited until quarter-past eleven, when Mr. Douglas\r\nupon his usual nightly round came into the room. He shot him and\r\nescaped, as arranged. He was aware that the bicycle would be described\r\nby the hotel people and be a clue against him; so he left it there and\r\nmade his way by some other means to London or to some safe hiding place\r\nwhich he had already arranged. How is that, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Mac, it is very good and very clear so far as it goes. That\r\nis your end of the story. My end is that the crime was committed half\r\nan hour earlier than reported; that Mrs. Douglas and Barker are both in\r\na conspiracy to conceal something; that they aided the murderer's\r\nescape--or at least that they reached the room before he escaped--and\r\nthat they fabricated evidence of his escape through the window, whereas\r\nin all probability they had themselves let him go by lowering the\r\nbridge. That's my reading of the first half.\"\r\n\r\nThe two detectives shook their heads.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, if this is true, we only tumble out of one mystery\r\ninto another,\" said the London inspector.\r\n\r\n\"And in some ways a worse one,\" added White Mason. \"The lady has never\r\nbeen in America in all her life. What possible connection could she\r\nhave with an American assassin which would cause her to shelter him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I freely admit the difficulties,\" said Holmes. \"I propose to make a\r\nlittle investigation of my own to-night, and it is just possible that\r\nit may contribute something to the common cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can we help you, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no! Darkness and Dr. Watson's umbrella--my wants are simple. And\r\nAmes, the faithful Ames, no doubt he will stretch a point for me. All\r\nmy lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic\r\nquestion--why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so\r\nunnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell?\"\r\n\r\nIt was late that night when Holmes returned from his solitary\r\nexcursion. We slept in a double-bedded room, which was the best that\r\nthe little country inn could do for us. I was already asleep when I was\r\npartly awakened by his entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Holmes,\" I murmured, \"have you found anything out?\"\r\n\r\nHe stood beside me in silence, his candle in his hand. Then the tall,\r\nlean figure inclined towards me. \"I say, Watson,\" he whispered, \"would\r\nyou be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic, a man with\r\nsoftening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least,\" I answered in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that's lucky,\" he said, and not another word would he utter that\r\nnight.\r\n\nNext morning, after breakfast, we found Inspector MacDonald and White\r\nMason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local\r\npolice sergeant. On the table in front of them were piled a number of\r\nletters and telegrams, which they were carefully sorting and docketing.\r\nThree had been placed on one side.\r\n\r\n\"Still on the track of the elusive bicyclist?\" Holmes asked cheerfully.\r\n\"What is the latest news of the ruffian?\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence.\r\n\r\n\"He is at present reported from Leicester, Nottingham, Southampton,\r\nDerby, East Ham, Richmond, and fourteen other places. In three of\r\nthem--East Ham, Leicester, and Liverpool--there is a clear case against\r\nhim, and he has actually been arrested. The country seems to be full of\r\nthe fugitives with yellow coats.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said Holmes sympathetically. \"Now, Mr. Mac and you, Mr.\r\nWhite Mason, I wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice. When I\r\nwent into this case with you I bargained, as you will no doubt\r\nremember, that I should not present you with half-proved theories, but\r\nthat I should retain and work out my own ideas until I had satisfied\r\nmyself that they were correct. For this reason I am not at the present\r\nmoment telling you all that is in my mind. On the other hand, I said\r\nthat I would play the game fairly by you, and I do not think it is a\r\nfair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to waste your\r\nenergies upon a profitless task. Therefore I am here to advise you this\r\nmorning, and my advice to you is summed up in three words--abandon the\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nMacDonald and White Mason stared in amazement at their celebrated\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\"You consider it hopeless!\" cried the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"I consider your case to be hopeless. I do not consider that it is\r\nhopeless to arrive at the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this cyclist. He is not an invention. We have his description, his\r\nvalise, his bicycle. The fellow must be somewhere. Why should we not\r\nget him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, no doubt he is somewhere, and no doubt we shall get him; but\r\nI would not have you waste your energies in East Ham or Liverpool. I am\r\nsure that we can find some shorter cut to a result.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are holding something back. It's hardly fair of you, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\nThe inspector was annoyed.\r\n\r\n\"You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for the\r\nshortest time possible. I only wish to verify my details in one way,\r\nwhich can very readily be done, and then I make my bow and return to\r\nLondon, leaving my results entirely at your service. I owe you too much\r\nto act otherwise; for in all my experience I cannot recall any more\r\nsingular and interesting study.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is clean beyond me, Mr. Holmes. We saw you when we returned from\r\nTunbridge Wells last night, and you were in general agreement with our\r\nresults. What has happened since then to give you a completely new idea\r\nof the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, since you ask me, I spent, as I told you that I would, some\r\nhours last night at the Manor House.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I can only give you a very general answer to that for the moment.\r\nBy the way, I have been reading a short but clear and interesting\r\naccount of the old building, purchasable at the modest sum of one penny\r\nfrom the local tobacconist.\"\r\n\r\nHere Holmes drew a small tract, embellished with a rude engraving of\r\nthe ancient Manor House, from his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n\"It immensely adds to the zest of an investigation, my dear Mr. Mac,\r\nwhen one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of\r\none's surroundings. Don't look so impatient; for I assure you that even\r\nso bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the past in\r\none's mind. Permit me to give you a sample. 'Erected in the fifth year\r\nof the reign of James I, and standing upon the site of a much older\r\nbuilding, the Manor House of Birlstone presents one of the finest\r\nsurviving examples of the moated Jacobean residence--'\"\r\n\r\n\"You are making fools of us, Mr. Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut, Mr. Mac!--the first sign of temper I have detected in you.\r\nWell, I won't read it verbatim, since you feel so strongly upon the\r\nsubject. But when I tell you that there is some account of the taking\r\nof the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644, of the concealment of\r\nCharles for several days in the course of the Civil War, and finally of\r\na visit there by the second George, you will admit that there are\r\nvarious associations of interest connected with this ancient house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't doubt it, Mr. Holmes; but that is no business of ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it not? Is it not? Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the\r\nessentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique\r\nuses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest. You will excuse\r\nthese remarks from one who, though a mere connoisseur of crime, is\r\nstill rather older and perhaps more experienced than yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm the first to admit that,\" said the detective heartily. \"You get to\r\nyour point, I admit; but you have such a deuced round-the-corner way of\r\ndoing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, I'll drop past history and get down to present-day facts.\r\nI called last night, as I have already said, at the Manor House. I did\r\nnot see either Barker or Mrs. Douglas. I saw no necessity to disturb\r\nthem; but I was pleased to hear that the lady was not visibly pining\r\nand that she had partaken of an excellent dinner. My visit was\r\nspecially made to the good Mr. Ames, with whom I exchanged some\r\namiabilities, which culminated in his allowing me, without reference to\r\nanyone else, to sit alone for a time in the study.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! With that?\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, everything is now in order. You gave permission for that, Mr.\r\nMac, as I am informed. The room was in its normal state, and in it I\r\npassed an instructive quarter of an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not to make a mystery of so simple a matter, I was looking for\r\nthe missing dumb-bell. It has always bulked rather large in my estimate\r\nof the case. I ended by finding it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there we come to the edge of the unexplored. Let me go a little\r\nfurther, a very little further, and I will promise that you shall share\r\neverything that I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're bound to take you on your own terms,\" said the inspector;\r\n\"but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case--why in the name\r\nof goodness should we abandon the case?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the simple reason, my dear Mr. Mac, that you have not got the\r\nfirst idea what it is that you are investigating.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are investigating the murder of Mr. John Douglas of Birlstone\r\nManor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, so you are. But don't trouble to trace the mysterious\r\ngentleman upon the bicycle. I assure you that it won't help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what do you suggest that we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you exactly what to do, if you will do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm bound to say I've always found you had reason behind all\r\nyour queer ways. I'll do what you advise.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Mr. White Mason?\"\r\n\r\nThe country detective looked helplessly from one to the other. Holmes\r\nand his methods were new to him. \"Well, if it is good enough for the\r\ninspector, it is good enough for me,\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" said Holmes. \"Well, then, I should recommend a nice, cheery\r\ncountry walk for both of you. They tell me that the views from\r\nBirlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No doubt lunch\r\ncould be got at some suitable hostelry; though my ignorance of the\r\ncountry prevents me from recommending one. In the evening, tired but\r\nhappy--\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, this is getting past a joke!\" cried MacDonald, rising angrily\r\nfrom his chair.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, spend the day as you like,\" said Holmes, patting him\r\ncheerfully upon the shoulder. \"Do what you like and go where you will,\r\nbut meet me here before dusk without fail--without fail, Mr. Mac.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds more like sanity.\"\r\n\r\n\"All of it was excellent advice; but I don't insist, so long as you are\r\nhere when I need you. But now, before we part, I want you to write a\r\nnote to Mr. Barker.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll dictate it, if you like. Ready?\r\n\r\n      \"Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n        \"It has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat, in\r\n      the hope that we may find some--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"It's impossible,\" said the inspector. \"I've made inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut! My dear sir, please do what I ask you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go on.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"--in the hope that we may find something which may bear\r\n      upon our investigation. I have made arrangements, and the\r\n      workmen will be at work early to-morrow morning diverting\r\n      the stream--\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n      \"--diverting the stream; so I thought it best to explain\r\n      matters beforehand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Now sign that, and send it by hand about four o'clock. At that hour we\r\nshall meet again in this room. Until then we may each do what we like;\r\nfor I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite pause.\"\r\n\r\nEvening was drawing in when we reassembled. Holmes was very serious in\r\nhis manner, myself curious, and the detectives obviously critical and\r\nannoyed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said my friend gravely, \"I am asking you now to put\r\neverything to the test with me, and you will judge for yourselves\r\nwhether the observations I have made justify the conclusions to which I\r\nhave come. It is a chill evening, and I do not know how long our\r\nexpedition may last; so I beg that you will wear your warmest coats. It\r\nis of the first importance that we should be in our places before it\r\ngrows dark; so with your permission we shall get started at once.\"\r\n\r\nWe passed along the outer bounds of the Manor House park until we came\r\nto a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it. Through\r\nthis we slipped, and then in the gathering gloom we followed Holmes\r\nuntil we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to the main\r\ndoor and the drawbridge. The latter had not been raised. Holmes\r\ncrouched down behind the screen of laurels, and we all three followed\r\nhis example.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what are we to do now?\" asked MacDonald with some gruffness.\r\n\r\n\"Possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible,\"\r\nHolmes answered.\r\n\r\n\"What are we here for at all? I really think that you might treat us\r\nwith more frankness.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed. \"Watson insists that I am the dramatist in real life,\"\r\nsaid he. \"Some touch of the artist wells up within me, and calls\r\ninsistently for a well-staged performance. Surely our profession, Mr.\r\nMac, would be a drab and sordid one if we did not sometimes set the\r\nscene so as to glorify our results. The blunt accusation, the brutal\r\ntap upon the shoulder--what can one make of such a denouement? But the\r\nquick inference, the subtle trap, the clever forecast of coming events,\r\nthe triumphant vindication of bold theories--are these not the pride\r\nand the justification of our life's work? At the present moment you\r\nthrill with the glamour of the situation and the anticipation of the\r\nhunt. Where would be that thrill if I had been as definite as a\r\ntimetable? I only ask a little patience, Mr. Mac, and all will be clear\r\nto you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will come\r\nbefore we all get our death of cold,\" said the London detective with\r\ncomic resignation.\r\n\r\nWe all had good reason to join in the aspiration; for our vigil was a\r\nlong and bitter one. Slowly the shadows darkened over the long, sombre\r\nface of the old house. A cold, damp reek from the moat chilled us to\r\nthe bones and set our teeth chattering. There was a single lamp over\r\nthe gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study. Everything\r\nelse was dark and still.\r\n\r\n\"How long is this to last?\" asked the inspector finally. \"And what is\r\nit we are watching for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no more notion than you how long it is to last,\" Holmes\r\nanswered with some asperity. \"If criminals would always schedule their\r\nmovements like railway trains, it would certainly be more convenient\r\nfor all of us. As to what it is we--Well, that's what we are watching\r\nfor!\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the bright, yellow light in the study was obscured by\r\nsomebody passing to and fro before it. The laurels among which we lay\r\nwere immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet\r\nfrom it. Presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges, and we\r\ncould dimly see the dark outline of a man's head and shoulders looking\r\nout into the gloom. For some minutes he peered forth in furtive,\r\nstealthy fashion, as one who wishes to be assured that he is\r\nunobserved. Then he leaned forward, and in the intense silence we were\r\naware of the soft lapping of agitated water. He seemed to be stirring\r\nup the moat with something which he held in his hand. Then suddenly he\r\nhauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish--some large, round\r\nobject which obscured the light as it was dragged through the open\r\ncasement.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" cried Holmes. \"Now!\"\r\n\r\nWe were all upon our feet, staggering after him with our stiffened\r\nlimbs, while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at the\r\nbell. There was the rasping of bolts from the other side, and the\r\namazed Ames stood in the entrance. Holmes brushed him aside without a\r\nword and, followed by all of us, rushed into the room which had been\r\noccupied by the man whom we had been watching.\r\n\r\nThe oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from\r\noutside. It was now in the hand of Cecil Barker, who held it towards us\r\nas we entered. Its light shone upon his strong, resolute, clean-shaved\r\nface and his menacing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil is the meaning of all this?\" he cried. \"What are you\r\nafter, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes took a swift glance round, and then pounced upon a sodden bundle\r\ntied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust under the\r\nwriting table.\r\n\r\n\"This is what we are after, Mr. Barker--this bundle, weighted with a\r\ndumb-bell, which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat.\"\r\n\r\nBarker stared at Holmes with amazement in his face. \"How in thunder\r\ncame you to know anything about it?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Simply that I put it there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You put it there! You!\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I should have said 'replaced it there,'\" said Holmes. \"You\r\nwill remember, Inspector MacDonald, that I was somewhat struck by the\r\nabsence of a dumb-bell. I drew your attention to it; but with the\r\npressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the\r\nconsideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from it.\r\nWhen water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very far-fetched\r\nsupposition that something has been sunk in the water. The idea was at\r\nleast worth testing; so with the help of Ames, who admitted me to the\r\nroom, and the crook of Dr. Watson's umbrella, I was able last night to\r\nfish up and inspect this bundle.\r\n\r\n\"It was of the first importance, however, that we should be able to\r\nprove who placed it there. This we accomplished by the very obvious\r\ndevice of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow, which had,\r\nof course, the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would most\r\ncertainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do so. We\r\nhave no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took advantage of\r\nthe opportunity, and so, Mr. Barker, I think the word lies now with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes put the sopping bundle upon the table beside the lamp\r\nand undid the cord which bound it. From within he extracted a\r\ndumb-bell, which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner. Next he\r\ndrew forth a pair of boots. \"American, as you perceive,\" he remarked,\r\npointing to the toes. Then he laid upon the table a long, deadly,\r\nsheathed knife. Finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing, comprising\r\na complete set of underclothes, socks, a gray tweed suit, and a short\r\nyellow overcoat.\r\n\r\n\"The clothes are commonplace,\" remarked Holmes, \"save only the\r\novercoat, which is full of suggestive touches.\" He held it tenderly\r\ntowards the light. \"Here, as you perceive, is the inner pocket\r\nprolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for\r\nthe truncated fowling piece. The tailor's tab is on the neck--'Neal,\r\nOutfitter, Vermissa, U. S. A.' I have spent an instructive afternoon in\r\nthe rector's library, and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the fact\r\nthat Vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of the\r\nbest known coal and iron valleys in the United States. I have some\r\nrecollection, Mr. Barker, that you associated the coal districts with\r\nMr. Douglas's first wife, and it would surely not be too far-fetched an\r\ninference that the V. V. upon the card by the dead body might stand for\r\nVermissa Valley, or that this very valley which sends forth emissaries\r\nof murder may be that Valley of Fear of which we have heard. So much is\r\nfairly clear. And now, Mr. Barker, I seem to be standing rather in the\r\nway of your explanation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a sight to see Cecil Barker's expressive face during this\r\nexposition of the great detective. Anger, amazement, consternation, and\r\nindecision swept over it in turn. Finally he took refuge in a somewhat\r\nacrid irony.\r\n\r\n\"You know such a lot, Mr. Holmes, perhaps you had better tell us some\r\nmore,\" he sneered.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that I could tell you a great deal more, Mr. Barker;\r\nbut it would come with a better grace from you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you think so, do you? Well, all I can say is that if there's any\r\nsecret here it is not my secret, and I am not the man to give it away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you take that line, Mr. Barker,\" said the inspector quietly,\r\n\"we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant and can hold\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can do what you damn please about that,\" said Barker defiantly.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he was\r\nconcerned; for one had only to look at that granite face to realize\r\nthat no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead against his\r\nwill. The deadlock was broken, however, by a woman's voice. Mrs.\r\nDouglas had been standing listening at the half opened door, and now\r\nshe entered the room.\r\n\r\n\"You have done enough for now, Cecil,\" said she. \"Whatever comes of it\r\nin the future, you have done enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough and more than enough,\" remarked Sherlock Holmes gravely. \"I\r\nhave every sympathy with you, madam, and should strongly urge you to\r\nhave some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to\r\ntake the police voluntarily into your complete confidence. It may be\r\nthat I am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you\r\nconveyed to me through my friend, Dr. Watson; but, at that time I had\r\nevery reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the crime.\r\nNow I am assured that this is not so. At the same time, there is much\r\nthat is unexplained, and I should strongly recommend that you ask Mr.\r\nDouglas to tell us his own story.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Douglas gave a cry of astonishment at Holmes's words. The\r\ndetectives and I must have echoed it, when we were aware of a man who\r\nseemed to have emerged from the wall, who advanced now from the gloom\r\nof the corner in which he had appeared. Mrs. Douglas turned, and in an\r\ninstant her arms were round him. Barker had seized his outstretched\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"It's best this way, Jack,\" his wife repeated; \"I am sure that it is\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, yes, Mr. Douglas,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"I am sure that you\r\nwill find it best.\"\r\n\r\nThe man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes from\r\nthe dark into the light. It was a remarkable face, bold gray eyes, a\r\nstrong, short-clipped, grizzled moustache, a square, projecting chin,\r\nand a humorous mouth. He took a good look at us all, and then to my\r\namazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of paper.\r\n\r\n\"I've heard of you,\" said he in a voice which was not quite English and\r\nnot quite American, but was altogether mellow and pleasing. \"You are\r\nthe historian of this bunch. Well, Dr. Watson, you've never had such a\r\nstory as that pass through your hands before, and I'll lay my last\r\ndollar on that. Tell it your own way; but there are the facts, and you\r\ncan't miss the public so long as you have those. I've been cooped up\r\ntwo days, and I've spent the daylight hours--as much daylight as I\r\ncould get in that rat trap--in putting the thing into words. You're\r\nwelcome to them--you and your public. There's the story of the Valley\r\nof Fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the past, Mr. Douglas,\" said Sherlock Holmes quietly. \"What we\r\ndesire now is to hear your story of the present.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll have it, sir,\" said Douglas. \"May I smoke as I talk? Well,\r\nthank you, Mr. Holmes. You're a smoker yourself, if I remember right,\r\nand you'll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco in\r\nyour pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away.\" He leaned\r\nagainst the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which Holmes had handed\r\nhim. \"I've heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I never guessed that I should meet\r\nyou. But before you are through with that,\" he nodded at my papers,\r\n\"you will say I've brought you something fresh.\"\r\n\r\nInspector MacDonald had been staring at the newcomer with the greatest\r\namazement. \"Well, this fairly beats me!\" he cried at last. \"If you are\r\nMr. John Douglas of Birlstone Manor, then whose death have we been\r\ninvestigating for these two days, and where in the world have you\r\nsprung from now? You seemed to me to come out of the floor like a\r\njack-in-a-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Mac,\" said Holmes, shaking a reproving forefinger, \"you would\r\nnot read that excellent local compilation which described the\r\nconcealment of King Charles. People did not hide in those days without\r\nexcellent hiding places, and the hiding place that has once been used\r\nmay be again. I had persuaded myself that we should find Mr. Douglas\r\nunder this roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how long have you been playing this trick upon us, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\nsaid the inspector angrily. \"How long have you allowed us to waste\r\nourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not one instant, my dear Mr. Mac. Only last night did I form my views\r\nof the case. As they could not be put to the proof until this evening,\r\nI invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the day. Pray\r\nwhat more could I do? When I found the suit of clothes in the moat, it\r\nat once became apparent to me that the body we had found could not have\r\nbeen the body of Mr. John Douglas at all, but must be that of the\r\nbicyclist from Tunbridge Wells. No other conclusion was possible.\r\nTherefore I had to determine where Mr. John Douglas himself could be,\r\nand the balance of probability was that with the connivance of his wife\r\nand his friend he was concealed in a house which had such conveniences\r\nfor a fugitive, and awaiting quieter times when he could make his final\r\nescape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you figured it out about right,\" said Douglas approvingly. \"I\r\nthought I'd dodge your British law; for I was not sure how I stood\r\nunder it, and also I saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all\r\noff my track. Mind you, from first to last I have done nothing to be\r\nashamed of, and nothing that I would not do again; but you'll judge\r\nthat for yourselves when I tell you my story. Never mind warning me,\r\nInspector: I'm ready to stand pat upon the truth.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to begin at the beginning. That's all there,\" he\r\nindicated my bundle of papers, \"and a mighty queer yarn you'll find it.\r\nIt all comes down to this: That there are some men that have good cause\r\nto hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they had got\r\nme. So long as I am alive and they are alive, there is no safety in\r\nthis world for me. They hunted me from Chicago to California, then they\r\nchased me out of America; but when I married and settled down in this\r\nquiet spot I thought my last years were going to be peaceable.\r\n\r\n\"I never explained to my wife how things were. Why should I pull her\r\ninto it? She would never have a quiet moment again; but would always be\r\nimagining trouble. I fancy she knew something, for I may have dropped a\r\nword here or a word there; but until yesterday, after you gentlemen had\r\nseen her, she never knew the rights of the matter. She told you all she\r\nknew, and so did Barker here; for on the night when this thing happened\r\nthere was mighty little time for explanations. She knows everything\r\nnow, and I would have been a wiser man if I had told her sooner. But it\r\nwas a hard question, dear,\" he took her hand for an instant in his own,\r\n\"and I acted for the best.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, the day before these happenings I was over in\r\nTunbridge Wells, and I got a glimpse of a man in the street. It was\r\nonly a glimpse; but I have a quick eye for these things, and I never\r\ndoubted who it was. It was the worst enemy I had among them all--one\r\nwho has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these\r\nyears. I knew there was trouble coming, and I came home and made ready\r\nfor it. I guessed I'd fight through it all right on my own, my luck was\r\na proverb in the States about '76. I never doubted that it would be\r\nwith me still.\r\n\r\n\"I was on my guard all that next day, and never went out into the park.\r\nIt's as well, or he'd have had the drop on me with that buckshot gun of\r\nhis before ever I could draw on him. After the bridge was up--my mind\r\nwas always more restful when that bridge was up in the evenings--I put\r\nthe thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed of his getting into the\r\nhouse and waiting for me. But when I made my round in my dressing gown,\r\nas was my habit, I had no sooner entered the study than I scented\r\ndanger. I guess when a man has had dangers in his life--and I've had\r\nmore than most in my time--there is a kind of sixth sense that waves\r\nthe red flag. I saw the signal clear enough, and yet I couldn't tell\r\nyou why. Next instant I spotted a boot under the window curtain, and\r\nthen I saw why plain enough.\r\n\r\n\"I'd just the one candle that was in my hand; but there was a good\r\nlight from the hall lamp through the open door. I put down the candle\r\nand jumped for a hammer that I'd left on the mantel. At the same moment\r\nhe sprang at me. I saw the glint of a knife, and I lashed at him with\r\nthe hammer. I got him somewhere; for the knife tinkled down on the\r\nfloor. He dodged round the table as quick as an eel, and a moment later\r\nhe'd got his gun from under his coat. I heard him cock it; but I had\r\ngot hold of it before he could fire. I had it by the barrel, and we\r\nwrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more. It was death to the\r\nman that lost his grip.\r\n\r\n\"He never lost his grip; but he got it butt downward for a moment too\r\nlong. Maybe it was I that pulled the trigger. Maybe we just jolted it\r\noff between us. Anyhow, he got both barrels in the face, and there I\r\nwas, staring down at all that was left of Ted Baldwin. I'd recognized\r\nhim in the township, and again when he sprang for me; but his own\r\nmother wouldn't recognize him as I saw him then. I'm used to rough\r\nwork; but I fairly turned sick at the sight of him.\r\n\r\n\"I was hanging on the side of the table when Barker came hurrying down.\r\nI heard my wife coming, and I ran to the door and stopped her. It was\r\nno sight for a woman. I promised I'd come to her soon. I said a word or\r\ntwo to Barker--he took it all in at a glance--and we waited for the\r\nrest to come along. But there was no sign of them. Then we understood\r\nthat they could hear nothing, and that all that had happened was known\r\nonly to ourselves.\r\n\r\n\"It was at that instant that the idea came to me. I was fairly dazzled\r\nby the brilliance of it. The man's sleeve had slipped up and there was\r\nthe branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm. See here!\"\r\n\r\nThe man whom we had known as Douglas turned up his own coat and cuff to\r\nshow a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we had\r\nseen upon the dead man.\r\n\r\n\"It was the sight of that which started me on it. I seemed to see it\r\nall clear at a glance. There were his height and hair and figure, about\r\nthe same as my own. No one could swear to his face, poor devil! I\r\nbrought down this suit of clothes, and in a quarter of an hour Barker\r\nand I had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found him. We\r\ntied all his things into a bundle, and I weighted them with the only\r\nweight I could find and put them through the window. The card he had\r\nmeant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own.\r\n\r\n\"My rings were put on his finger; but when it came to the wedding\r\nring,\" he held out his muscular hand, \"you can see for yourselves that\r\nI had struck the limit. I have not moved it since the day I was\r\nmarried, and it would have taken a file to get it off. I don't know,\r\nanyhow, that I should have cared to part with it; but if I had wanted\r\nto I couldn't. So we just had to leave that detail to take care of\r\nitself. On the other hand, I brought a bit of plaster down and put it\r\nwhere I am wearing one myself at this instant. You slipped up there,\r\nMr. Holmes, clever as you are; for if you had chanced to take off that\r\nplaster you would have found no cut underneath it.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was the situation. If I could lie low for a while and then\r\nget away where I could be joined by my 'widow' we should have a chance\r\nat last of living in peace for the rest of our lives. These devils\r\nwould give me no rest so long as I was above ground; but if they saw in\r\nthe papers that Baldwin had got his man, there would be an end of all\r\nmy troubles. I hadn't much time to make it all clear to Barker and to\r\nmy wife; but they understood enough to be able to help me. I knew all\r\nabout this hiding place, so did Ames; but it never entered his head to\r\nconnect it with the matter. I retired into it, and it was up to Barker\r\nto do the rest.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did. He opened the\r\nwindow and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the\r\nmurderer escaped. It was a tall order, that; but as the bridge was up\r\nthere was no other way. Then, when everything was fixed, he rang the\r\nbell for all he was worth. What happened afterward you know. And so,\r\ngentlemen, you can do what you please; but I've told you the truth and\r\nthe whole truth, so help me God! What I ask you now is how do I stand\r\nby the English law?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence which was broken by Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"The English law is in the main a just law. You will get no worse than\r\nyour deserts from that, Mr. Douglas. But I would ask you how did this\r\nman know that you lived here, or how to get into your house, or where\r\nto hide to get you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing of this.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes's face was very white and grave. \"The story is not over yet, I\r\nfear,\" said he. \"You may find worse dangers than the English law, or\r\neven than your enemies from America. I see trouble before you, Mr.\r\nDouglas. You'll take my advice and still be on your guard.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now, my long-suffering readers, I will ask you to come away with me\r\nfor a time, far from the Sussex Manor House of Birlstone, and far also\r\nfrom the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey which\r\nended with the strange story of the man who had been known as John\r\nDouglas. I wish you to journey back some twenty years in time, and\r\nwestward some thousands of miles in space, that I may lay before you a\r\nsingular and terrible narrative--so singular and so terrible that you\r\nmay find it hard to believe that even as I tell it, even so did it\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nDo not think that I intrude one story before another is finished. As\r\nyou read on you will find that this is not so. And when I have detailed\r\nthose distant events and you have solved this mystery of the past, we\r\nshall meet once more in those rooms on Baker Street, where this, like\r\nso many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.\r\n\nIt was the fourth of February in the year 1875. It had been a severe\r\nwinter, and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the Gilmerton Mountains.\r\nThe steam ploughs had, however, kept the railroad open, and the evening\r\ntrain which connects the long line of coal-mining and iron-working\r\nsettlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep gradients which\r\nlead from Stagville on the plain to Vermissa, the central township\r\nwhich lies at the head of Vermissa Valley. From this point the track\r\nsweeps downward to Bartons Crossing, Helmdale, and the purely\r\nagricultural county of Merton. It was a single-track railroad; but at\r\nevery siding--and they were numerous--long lines of trucks piled with\r\ncoal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which had brought a rude\r\npopulation and a bustling life to this most desolate corner of the\r\nUnited States of America.\r\n\r\nFor desolate it was! Little could the first pioneer who had traversed\r\nit have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush water\r\npastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black crag and\r\ntangled forest. Above the dark and often scarcely penetrable woods upon\r\ntheir flanks, the high, bare crowns of the mountains, white snow, and\r\njagged rock towered upon each flank, leaving a long, winding, tortuous\r\nvalley in the centre. Up this the little train was slowly crawling.\r\n\r\nThe oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car, a long,\r\nbare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated. The\r\ngreater number of these were workmen returning from their day's toil in\r\nthe lower part of the valley. At least a dozen, by their grimed faces\r\nand the safety lanterns which they carried, proclaimed themselves\r\nminers. These sat smoking in a group and conversed in low voices,\r\nglancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the car, whose\r\nuniforms and badges showed them to be policemen.\r\n\r\nSeveral women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who\r\nmight have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the\r\ncompany, with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself. It\r\nis with this man that we are concerned. Take a good look at him, for he\r\nis worth it.\r\n\r\nHe is a fresh-complexioned, middle-sized young man, not far, one would\r\nguess, from his thirtieth year. He has large, shrewd, humorous gray\r\neyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks round\r\nthrough his spectacles at the people about him. It is easy to see that\r\nhe is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition, anxious to be\r\nfriendly to all men. Anyone could pick him at once as gregarious in his\r\nhabits and communicative in his nature, with a quick wit and a ready\r\nsmile. And yet the man who studied him more closely might discern a\r\ncertain firmness of jaw and grim tightness about the lips which would\r\nwarn him that there were depths beyond, and that this pleasant,\r\nbrown-haired young Irishman might conceivably leave his mark for good\r\nor evil upon any society to which he was introduced.\r\n\r\nHaving made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner, and\r\nreceiving only short, gruff replies, the traveller resigned himself to\r\nuncongenial silence, staring moodily out of the window at the fading\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\nIt was not a cheering prospect. Through the growing gloom there pulsed\r\nthe red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills. Great heaps of\r\nslag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side, with the high shafts\r\nof the collieries towering above them. Huddled groups of mean, wooden\r\nhouses, the windows of which were beginning to outline themselves in\r\nlight, were scattered here and there along the line, and the frequent\r\nhalting places were crowded with their swarthy inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe iron and coal valleys of the Vermissa district were no resorts for\r\nthe leisured or the cultured. Everywhere there were stern signs of the\r\ncrudest battle of life, the rude work to be done, and the rude, strong\r\nworkers who did it.\r\n\r\nThe young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of\r\nmingled repulsion and interest, which showed that the scene was new to\r\nhim. At intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which he\r\nreferred, and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes. Once\r\nfrom the back of his waist he produced something which one would hardly\r\nhave expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a man. It\r\nwas a navy revolver of the largest size. As he turned it slantwise to\r\nthe light, the glint upon the rims of the copper shells within the drum\r\nshowed that it was fully loaded. He quickly restored it to his secret\r\npocket, but not before it had been observed by a working man who had\r\nseated himself upon the adjoining bench.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, mate!\" said he. \"You seem heeled and ready.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man smiled with an air of embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"we need them sometimes in the place I come from.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where may that be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm last from Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"A stranger in these parts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may find you need it here,\" said the workman.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! is that so?\" The young man seemed interested.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I thought the country was full of it. You'll hear quick enough.\r\nWhat made you come here?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard there was always work for a willing man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you a member of the union?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll get your job, I guess. Have you any friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet; but I have the means of making them.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am one of the Eminent Order of Freemen. There's no town without a\r\nlodge, and where there is a lodge I'll find my friends.\"\r\n\r\nThe remark had a singular effect upon his companion. He glanced round\r\nsuspiciously at the others in the car. The miners were still whispering\r\namong themselves. The two police officers were dozing. He came across,\r\nseated himself close to the young traveller, and held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Put it there,\" he said.\r\n\r\nA hand-grip passed between the two.\r\n\r\n\"I see you speak the truth,\" said the workman. \"But it's well to make\r\ncertain.\" He raised his right hand to his right eyebrow. The traveller\r\nat once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow.\r\n\r\n\"Dark nights are unpleasant,\" said the workman.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for strangers to travel,\" the other answered.\r\n\r\n\"That's good enough. I'm Brother Scanlan, Lodge 341, Vermissa Valley.\r\nGlad to see you in these parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. I'm Brother John McMurdo, Lodge 29, Chicago. Bodymaster J.\r\nH. Scott. But I am in luck to meet a brother so early.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are plenty of us about. You won't find the order more\r\nflourishing anywhere in the States than right here in Vermissa Valley.\r\nBut we could do with some lads like you. I can't understand a spry man\r\nof the union finding no work to do in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"I found plenty of work to do,\" said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"Then why did you leave?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled. \"I guess those chaps\r\nwould be glad to know,\" he said.\r\n\r\nScanlan groaned sympathetically. \"In trouble?\" he asked in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"Deep.\"\r\n\r\n\"A penitentiary job?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a killing!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's early days to talk of such things,\" said McMurdo with the air of\r\na man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended. \"I've\r\nmy own good reasons for leaving Chicago, and let that be enough for\r\nyou. Who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such\r\nthings?\" His gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from\r\nbehind his glasses.\r\n\r\n\"All right, mate, no offense meant. The boys will think none the worse\r\nof you, whatever you may have done. Where are you bound for now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vermissa.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the third halt down the line. Where are you staying?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp.\r\n\"Here is the address--Jacob Shafter, Sheridan Street. It's a boarding\r\nhouse that was recommended by a man I knew in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know it; but Vermissa is out of my beat. I live at\r\nHobson's Patch, and that's here where we are drawing up. But, say,\r\nthere's one bit of advice I'll give you before we part: If you're in\r\ntrouble in Vermissa, go straight to the Union House and see Boss\r\nMcGinty. He is the Bodymaster of Vermissa Lodge, and nothing can happen\r\nin these parts unless Black Jack McGinty wants it. So long, mate! Maybe\r\nwe'll meet in lodge one of these evenings. But mind my words: If you\r\nare in trouble, go to Boss McGinty.\"\r\n\r\nScanlan descended, and McMurdo was left once again to his thoughts.\r\nNight had now fallen, and the flames of the frequent furnaces were\r\nroaring and leaping in the darkness. Against their lurid background\r\ndark figures were bending and straining, twisting and turning, with the\r\nmotion of winch or of windlass, to the rhythm of an eternal clank and\r\nroar.\r\n\r\n\"I guess hell must look something like that,\" said a voice.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his\r\nseat and was staring out into the fiery waste.\r\n\r\n\"For that matter,\" said the other policeman, \"I allow that hell must be\r\nsomething like that. If there are worse devils down yonder than some we\r\ncould name, it's more than I'd expect. I guess you are new to this\r\npart, young man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what if I am?\" McMurdo answered in a surly voice.\r\n\r\n\"Just this, mister, that I should advise you to be careful in choosing\r\nyour friends. I don't think I'd begin with Mike Scanlan or his gang if\r\nI were you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the hell is it to you who are my friends?\" roared McMurdo in a\r\nvoice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the\r\naltercation. \"Did I ask you for your advice, or did you think me such a\r\nsucker that I couldn't move without it? You speak when you are spoken\r\nto, and by the Lord you'd have to wait a long time if it was me!\" He\r\nthrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a snarling dog.\r\n\r\nThe two policemen, heavy, good-natured men, were taken aback by the\r\nextraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n\"No offense, stranger,\" said one. \"It was a warning for your own good,\r\nseeing that you are, by your own showing, new to the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm new to the place; but I'm not new to you and your kind!\" cried\r\nMcMurdo in cold fury. \"I guess you're the same in all places, shoving\r\nyour advice in when nobody asks for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe we'll see more of you before very long,\" said one of the\r\npatrolmen with a grin. \"You're a real hand-picked one, if I am a judge.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking the same,\" remarked the other. \"I guess we may meet\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid of you, and don't you think it!\" cried McMurdo. \"My\r\nname's Jack McMurdo--see? If you want me, you'll find me at Jacob\r\nShafter's on Sheridan Street, Vermissa; so I'm not hiding from you, am\r\nI? Day or night I dare to look the like of you in the face--don't make\r\nany mistake about that!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the\r\ndauntless demeanour of the newcomer, while the two policemen shrugged\r\ntheir shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station, and there\r\nwas a general clearing; for Vermissa was by far the largest town on the\r\nline. McMurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to start off\r\ninto the darkness, when one of the miners accosted him.\r\n\r\n\"By Gar, mate! you know how to speak to the cops,\" he said in a voice\r\nof awe. \"It was grand to hear you. Let me carry your grip and show you\r\nthe road. I'm passing Shafter's on the way to my own shack.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of friendly \"Good-nights\" from the other miners as\r\nthey passed from the platform. Before ever he had set foot in it,\r\nMcMurdo the turbulent had become a character in Vermissa.\r\n\r\nThe country had been a place of terror; but the town was in its way\r\neven more depressing. Down that long valley there was at least a\r\ncertain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting\r\nsmoke, while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments\r\nin the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous\r\nexcavations. But the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and\r\nsqualor. The broad street was churned up by the traffic into a horrible\r\nrutted paste of muddy snow. The sidewalks were narrow and uneven. The\r\nnumerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a long line of\r\nwooden houses, each with its veranda facing the street, unkempt and\r\ndirty.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by a\r\nrow of well-lit stores, and even more by a cluster of saloons and\r\ngaming houses, in which the miners spent their hard-earned but generous\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n\"That's the Union House,\" said the guide, pointing to one saloon which\r\nrose almost to the dignity of being a hotel. \"Jack McGinty is the boss\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a man is he?\" McMurdo asked.\r\n\r\n\"What! have you never heard of the boss?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I have heard of him when you know that I am a stranger in\r\nthese parts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I thought his name was known clear across the country. It's been\r\nin the papers often enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" the miner lowered his voice--\"over the affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What affairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, mister! you are queer, if I must say it without offense.\r\nThere's only one set of affairs that you'll hear of in these parts, and\r\nthat's the affairs of the Scowrers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I seem to have read of the Scowrers in Chicago. A gang of\r\nmurderers, are they not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, on your life!\" cried the miner, standing still in alarm, and\r\ngazing in amazement at his companion. \"Man, you won't live long in\r\nthese parts if you speak in the open street like that. Many a man has\r\nhad the life beaten out of him for less.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know nothing about them. It's only what I have read.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'm not saying that you have not read the truth.\" The man looked\r\nnervously round him as he spoke, peering into the shadows as if he\r\nfeared to see some lurking danger. \"If killing is murder, then God\r\nknows there is murder and to spare. But don't you dare to breathe the\r\nname of Jack McGinty in connection with it, stranger; for every whisper\r\ngoes back to him, and he is not one that is likely to let it pass. Now,\r\nthat's the house you're after, that one standing back from the street.\r\nYou'll find old Jacob Shafter that runs it as honest a man as lives in\r\nthis township.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said McMurdo, and shaking hands with his new\r\nacquaintance he plodded, gripsack in hand, up the path which led to the\r\ndwelling house, at the door of which he gave a resounding knock.\r\n\r\nIt was opened at once by someone very different from what he had\r\nexpected. It was a woman, young and singularly beautiful. She was of\r\nthe German type, blonde and fair-haired, with the piquant contrast of a\r\npair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger with\r\nsurprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of colour\r\nover her pale face. Framed in the bright light of the open doorway, it\r\nseemed to McMurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful picture; the\r\nmore attractive for its contrast with the sordid and gloomy\r\nsurroundings. A lovely violet growing upon one of those black\r\nslag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising. So\r\nentranced was he that he stood staring without a word, and it was she\r\nwho broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was father,\" said she with a pleasing little touch of a\r\nGerman accent. \"Did you come to see him? He is downtown. I expect him\r\nback every minute.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes\r\ndropped in confusion before this masterful visitor.\r\n\r\n\"No, miss,\" he said at last, \"I'm in no hurry to see him. But your\r\nhouse was recommended to me for board. I thought it might suit me--and\r\nnow I know it will.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quick to make up your mind,\" said she with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Anyone but a blind man could do as much,\" the other answered.\r\n\r\nShe laughed at the compliment. \"Come right in, sir,\" she said. \"I'm\r\nMiss Ettie Shafter, Mr. Shafter's daughter. My mother's dead, and I run\r\nthe house. You can sit down by the stove in the front room until father\r\ncomes along--Ah, here he is! So you can fix things with him right away.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy, elderly man came plodding up the path. In a few words McMurdo\r\nexplained his business. A man of the name of Murphy had given him the\r\naddress in Chicago. He in turn had had it from someone else. Old\r\nShafter was quite ready. The stranger made no bones about terms, agreed\r\nat once to every condition, and was apparently fairly flush of money.\r\nFor seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board and\r\nlodging.\r\n\r\nSo it was that McMurdo, the self-confessed fugitive from justice, took\r\nup his abode under the roof of the Shafters, the first step which was\r\nto lead to so long and dark a train of events, ending in a far distant\r\nland.\r\n\nMcMurdo was a man who made his mark quickly. Wherever he was the folk\r\naround soon knew it. Within a week he had become infinitely the most\r\nimportant person at Shafter's. There were ten or a dozen boarders\r\nthere; but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the\r\nstores, of a very different calibre from the young Irishman. Of an\r\nevening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest,\r\nhis conversation the brightest, and his song the best. He was a born\r\nboon companion, with a magnetism which drew good humour from all around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAnd yet he showed again and again, as he had shown in the railway\r\ncarriage, a capacity for sudden, fierce anger, which compelled the\r\nrespect and even the fear of those who met him. For the law, too, and\r\nall who were connected with it, he exhibited a bitter contempt which\r\ndelighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders.\r\n\r\nFrom the first he made it evident, by his open admiration, that the\r\ndaughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had\r\nset eyes upon her beauty and her grace. He was no backward suitor. On\r\nthe second day he told her that he loved her, and from then onward he\r\nrepeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might\r\nsay to discourage him.\r\n\r\n\"Someone else?\" he would cry. \"Well, the worse luck for someone else!\r\nLet him look out for himself! Am I to lose my life's chance and all my\r\nheart's desire for someone else? You can keep on saying no, Ettie: the\r\nday will come when you will say yes, and I'm young enough to wait.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a dangerous suitor, with his glib Irish tongue, and his pretty,\r\ncoaxing ways. There was about him also that glamour of experience and\r\nof mystery which attracts a woman's interest, and finally her love. He\r\ncould talk of the sweet valleys of County Monaghan from which he came,\r\nof the lovely, distant island, the low hills and green meadows of which\r\nseemed the more beautiful when imagination viewed them from this place\r\nof grime and snow.\r\n\r\nThen he was versed in the life of the cities of the North, of Detroit,\r\nand the lumber camps of Michigan, and finally of Chicago, where he had\r\nworked in a planing mill. And afterwards came the hint of romance, the\r\nfeeling that strange things had happened to him in that great city, so\r\nstrange and so intimate that they might not be spoken of. He spoke\r\nwistfully of a sudden leaving, a breaking of old ties, a flight into a\r\nstrange world, ending in this dreary valley, and Ettie listened, her\r\ndark eyes gleaming with pity and with sympathy--those two qualities\r\nwhich may turn so rapidly and so naturally to love.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper; for he was a\r\nwell-educated man. This kept him out most of the day, and he had not\r\nfound occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the\r\nEminent Order of Freemen. He was reminded of his omission, however, by\r\na visit one evening from Mike Scanlan, the fellow member whom he had\r\nmet in the train. Scanlan, the small, sharp-faced, nervous, black-eyed\r\nman, seemed glad to see him once more. After a glass or two of whisky\r\nhe broached the object of his visit.\r\n\r\n\"Say, McMurdo,\" said he, \"I remembered your address, so I made bold to\r\ncall. I'm surprised that you've not reported to the Bodymaster. Why\r\nhaven't you seen Boss McGinty yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had to find a job. I have been busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must find time for him if you have none for anything else. Good\r\nLord, man! you're a fool not to have been down to the Union House and\r\nregistered your name the first morning after you came here! If you run\r\nagainst him--well, you mustn't, that's all!\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo showed mild surprise. \"I've been a member of the lodge for over\r\ntwo years, Scanlan, but I never heard that duties were so pressing as\r\nall that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not in Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's the same society here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it?\"\r\n\r\nScanlan looked at him long and fixedly. There was something sinister in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll tell me that in a month's time. I hear you had a talk with the\r\npatrolmen after I left the train.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it got about--things do get about for good and for bad in this\r\ndistrict.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. I told the hounds what I thought of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Lord, you'll be a man after McGinty's heart!\"\r\n\r\n\"What, does he hate the police too?\"\r\n\r\nScanlan burst out laughing. \"You go and see him, my lad,\" said he as he\r\ntook his leave. \"It's not the police but you that he'll hate if you\r\ndon't! Now, take a friend's advice and go at once!\"\r\n\r\nIt chanced that on the same evening McMurdo had another more pressing\r\ninterview which urged him in the same direction. It may have been that\r\nhis attentions to Ettie had been more evident than before, or that they\r\nhad gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his good German\r\nhost; but, whatever the cause, the boarding-house keeper beckoned the\r\nyoung man into his private room and started on the subject without any\r\ncircumlocution.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me, mister,\" said he, \"that you are gettin' set on my\r\nEttie. Ain't that so, or am I wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is so,\" the young man answered.\r\n\r\n\"Vell, I vant to tell you right now that it ain't no manner of use.\r\nThere's someone slipped in afore you.\"\r\n\r\n\"She told me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vell, you can lay that she told you truth. But did she tell you who it\r\nvas?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I asked her; but she wouldn't tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say not, the leetle baggage! Perhaps she did not vish to\r\nfrighten you avay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frighten!\" McMurdo was on fire in a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, my friend! You need not be ashamed to be frightened of him.\r\nIt is Teddy Baldwin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who the devil is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a boss of Scowrers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scowrers! I've heard of them before. It's Scowrers here and Scowrers\r\nthere, and always in a whisper! What are you all afraid of? Who are the\r\nScowrers?\"\r\n\r\nThe boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice, as everyone did\r\nwho talked about that terrible society. \"The Scowrers,\" said he, \"are\r\nthe Eminent Order of Freemen!\"\r\n\r\nThe young man stared. \"Why, I am a member of that order myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You! I vould never have had you in my house if I had known it--not if\r\nyou vere to pay me a hundred dollar a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong with the order? It's for charity and good fellowship. The\r\nrules say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe in some places. Not here!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a murder society, that's vat it is.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed incredulously. \"How can you prove that?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Prove it! Are there not fifty murders to prove it? Vat about Milman\r\nand Van Shorst, and the Nicholson family, and old Mr. Hyam, and little\r\nBilly James, and the others? Prove it! Is there a man or a voman in\r\nthis valley vat does not know it?\"\r\n\r\n\"See here!\" said McMurdo earnestly. \"I want you to take back what\r\nyou've said, or else make it good. One or the other you must do before\r\nI quit this room. Put yourself in my place. Here am I, a stranger in\r\nthe town. I belong to a society that I know only as an innocent one.\r\nYou'll find it through the length and breadth of the States, but always\r\nas an innocent one. Now, when I am counting upon joining it here, you\r\ntell me that it is the same as a murder society called the Scowrers. I\r\nguess you owe me either an apology or else an explanation, Mr. Shafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows, mister. The bosses of\r\nthe one are the bosses of the other. If you offend the one, it is the\r\nother vat vill strike you. We have proved it too often.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just gossip--I want proof!\" said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"If you live here long you vill get your proof. But I forget that you\r\nare yourself one of them. You vill soon be as bad as the rest. But you\r\nvill find other lodgings, mister. I cannot have you here. Is it not bad\r\nenough that one of these people come courting my Ettie, and that I dare\r\nnot turn him down, but that I should have another for my boarder? Yes,\r\nindeed, you shall not sleep here after to-night!\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his\r\ncomfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved. He found her\r\nalone in the sitting-room that same evening, and he poured his troubles\r\ninto her ear.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, your father is after giving me notice,\" he said. \"It's little I\r\nwould care if it was just my room, but indeed, Ettie, though it's only\r\na week that I've known you, you are the very breath of life to me, and\r\nI can't live without you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hush, Mr. McMurdo, don't speak so!\" said the girl. \"I have told\r\nyou, have I not, that you are too late? There is another, and if I have\r\nnot promised to marry him at once, at least I can promise no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose I had been first, Ettie, would I have had a chance?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl sank her face into her hands. \"I wish to heaven that you had\r\nbeen first!\" she sobbed.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant. \"For God's\r\nsake, Ettie, let it stand at that!\" he cried. \"Will you ruin your life\r\nand my own for the sake of this promise? Follow your heart, acushla!\r\n'Tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it was that\r\nyou were saying.\"\r\n\r\nHe had seized Ettie's white hand between his own strong brown ones.\r\n\r\n\"Say that you will be mine, and we will face it out together!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Jack!\" His arms were round her now. \"It could not be here.\r\nCould you take me away?\"\r\n\r\nA struggle passed for a moment over McMurdo's face; but it ended by\r\nsetting like granite. \"No, here,\" he said. \"I'll hold you against the\r\nworld, Ettie, right here where we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we not leave together?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Ettie, I can't leave here.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd never hold my head up again if I felt that I had been driven out.\r\nBesides, what is there to be afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free\r\ncountry? If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know, Jack. You've been here too short a time. You don't\r\nknow this Baldwin. You don't know McGinty and his Scowrers.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't know them, and I don't fear them, and I don't believe in\r\nthem!\" said McMurdo. \"I've lived among rough men, my darling, and\r\ninstead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared\r\nme--always, Ettie. It's mad on the face of it! If these men, as your\r\nfather says, have done crime after crime in the valley, and if everyone\r\nknows them by name, how comes it that none are brought to justice? You\r\nanswer me that, Ettie!\"\r\n\r\n\"Because no witness dares to appear against them. He would not live a\r\nmonth if he did. Also because they have always their own men to swear\r\nthat the accused one was far from the scene of the crime. But surely,\r\nJack, you must have read all this. I had understood that every paper in\r\nthe United States was writing about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have read something, it is true; but I had thought it was a\r\nstory. Maybe these men have some reason in what they do. Maybe they are\r\nwronged and have no other way to help themselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, don't let me hear you speak so! That is how he speaks--the\r\nother one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Baldwin--he speaks like that, does he?\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is why I loathe him so. Oh, Jack, now I can tell you the\r\ntruth. I loathe him with all my heart; but I fear him also. I fear him\r\nfor myself; but above all I fear him for father. I know that some great\r\nsorrow would come upon us if I dared to say what I really felt. That is\r\nwhy I have put him off with half-promises. It was in real truth our\r\nonly hope. But if you would fly with me, Jack, we could take father\r\nwith us and live forever far from the power of these wicked men.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was the struggle upon McMurdo's face, and again it set like\r\ngranite. \"No harm shall come to you, Ettie--nor to your father either.\r\nAs to wicked men, I expect you may find that I am as bad as the worst\r\nof them before we're through.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Jack! I would trust you anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed bitterly. \"Good Lord! how little you know of me! Your\r\ninnocent soul, my darling, could not even guess what is passing in\r\nmine. But, hullo, who's the visitor?\"\r\n\r\nThe door had opened suddenly, and a young fellow came swaggering in\r\nwith the air of one who is the master. He was a handsome, dashing young\r\nman of about the same age and build as McMurdo himself. Under his\r\nbroad-brimmed black felt hat, which he had not troubled to remove, a\r\nhandsome face with fierce, domineering eyes and a curved hawk-bill of a\r\nnose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove.\r\n\r\nEttie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm. \"I'm glad to\r\nsee you, Mr. Baldwin,\" said she. \"You're earlier than I had thought.\r\nCome and sit down.\"\r\n\r\nBaldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at McMurdo. \"Who is\r\nthis?\" he asked curtly.\r\n\r\n\"It's a friend of mine, Mr. Baldwin, a new boarder here. Mr. McMurdo,\r\nmay I introduce you to Mr. Baldwin?\"\r\n\r\nThe young men nodded in surly fashion to each other.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe Miss Ettie has told you how it is with us?\" said Baldwin.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't understand that there was any relation between you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you? Well, you can understand it now. You can take it from me\r\nthat this young lady is mine, and you'll find it a very fine evening\r\nfor a walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, I am in no humour for a walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you?\" The man's savage eyes were blazing with anger. \"Maybe you\r\nare in a humour for a fight, Mr. Boarder!\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am!\" cried McMurdo, springing to his feet. \"You never said a\r\nmore welcome word.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Jack! Oh, for God's sake!\" cried poor, distracted\r\nEttie. \"Oh, Jack, Jack, he will hurt you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's Jack, is it?\" said Baldwin with an oath. \"You've come to that\r\nalready, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Ted, be reasonable--be kind! For my sake, Ted, if ever you loved\r\nme, be big-hearted and forgiving!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, Ettie, that if you were to leave us alone we could get this\r\nthing settled,\" said McMurdo quietly. \"Or maybe, Mr. Baldwin, you will\r\ntake a turn down the street with me. It's a fine evening, and there's\r\nsome open ground beyond the next block.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get even with you without needing to dirty my hands,\" said his\r\nenemy. \"You'll wish you had never set foot in this house before I am\r\nthrough with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No time like the present,\" cried McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"I'll choose my own time, mister. You can leave the time to me. See\r\nhere!\" He suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a\r\npeculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there. It was a\r\ncircle with a triangle within it. \"D'you know what that means?\"\r\n\r\n\"I neither know nor care!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will know, I'll promise you that. You won't be much older,\r\neither. Perhaps Miss Ettie can tell you something about it. As to you,\r\nEttie, you'll come back to me on your knees--d'ye hear, girl?--on your\r\nknees--and then I'll tell you what your punishment may be. You've\r\nsowed--and by the Lord, I'll see that you reap!\" He glanced at them\r\nboth in fury. Then he turned upon his heel, and an instant later the\r\nouter door had banged behind him.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments McMurdo and the girl stood in silence. Then she threw\r\nher arms around him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, how brave you were! But it is no use, you must fly!\r\nTo-night--Jack--to-night! It's your only hope. He will have your life.\r\nI read it in his horrible eyes. What chance have you against a dozen of\r\nthem, with Boss McGinty and all the power of the lodge behind them?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo disengaged her hands, kissed her, and gently pushed her back\r\ninto a chair. \"There, acushla, there! Don't be disturbed or fear for\r\nme. I'm a Freeman myself. I'm after telling your father about it. Maybe\r\nI am no better than the others; so don't make a saint of me. Perhaps\r\nyou hate me too, now that I've told you as much?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hate you, Jack? While life lasts I could never do that! I've heard\r\nthat there is no harm in being a Freeman anywhere but here; so why\r\nshould I think the worse of you for that? But if you are a Freeman,\r\nJack, why should you not go down and make a friend of Boss McGinty? Oh,\r\nhurry, Jack, hurry! Get your word in first, or the hounds will be on\r\nyour trail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking the same thing,\" said McMurdo. \"I'll go right now and\r\nfix it. You can tell your father that I'll sleep here to-night and find\r\nsome other quarters in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThe bar of McGinty's saloon was crowded as usual, for it was the\r\nfavourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town. The\r\nman was popular; for he had a rough, jovial disposition which formed a\r\nmask, covering a great deal which lay behind it. But apart from this\r\npopularity, the fear in which he was held throughout the township, and\r\nindeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and past the mountains\r\non each side of it, was enough in itself to fill his bar; for none\r\ncould afford to neglect his good will.\r\n\r\nBesides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he\r\nexercised in so pitiless a fashion, he was a high public official, a\r\nmunicipal councillor, and a commissioner of roads, elected to the\r\noffice through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to\r\nreceive favours at his hands. Assessments and taxes were enormous; the\r\npublic works were notoriously neglected, the accounts were slurred over\r\nby bribed auditors, and the decent citizen was terrorized into paying\r\npublic blackmail, and holding his tongue lest some worse thing befall\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThus it was that, year by year, Boss McGinty's diamond pins became more\r\nobtrusive, his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous vest,\r\nand his saloon stretched farther and farther, until it threatened to\r\nabsorb one whole side of the Market Square.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way\r\namid the crowd of men within, through an atmosphere blurred with\r\ntobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits. The place was\r\nbrilliantly lighted, and the huge, heavily gilt mirrors upon every wall\r\nreflected and multiplied the garish illumination. There were several\r\nbartenders in their shirt sleeves, hard at work mixing drinks for the\r\nloungers who fringed the broad, brass-trimmed counter.\r\n\r\nAt the far end, with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck at\r\nan acute angle from the corner of his mouth, stood a tall, strong,\r\nheavily built man who could be none other than the famous McGinty\r\nhimself. He was a black-maned giant, bearded to the cheek-bones, and\r\nwith a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar. His complexion was\r\nas swarthy as that of an Italian, and his eyes were of a strange dead\r\nblack, which, combined with a slight squint, gave them a particularly\r\nsinister appearance.\r\n\r\nAll else in the man--his noble proportions, his fine features, and his\r\nfrank bearing--fitted in with that jovial, man-to-man manner which he\r\naffected. Here, one would say, is a bluff, honest fellow, whose heart\r\nwould be sound however rude his outspoken words might seem. It was only\r\nwhen those dead, dark eyes, deep and remorseless, were turned upon a\r\nman that he shrank within himself, feeling that he was face to face\r\nwith an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a strength and\r\ncourage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand times more\r\ndeadly.\r\n\r\nHaving had a good look at his man, McMurdo elbowed his way forward with\r\nhis usual careless audacity, and pushed himself through the little\r\ngroup of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss, laughing\r\nuproariously at the smallest of his jokes. The young stranger's bold\r\ngray eyes looked back fearlessly through their glasses at the deadly\r\nblack ones which turned sharply upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young man, I can't call your face to mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm new here, Mr. McGinty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not so new that you can't give a gentleman his proper title.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's Councillor McGinty, young man,\" said a voice from the group.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Councillor. I'm strange to the ways of the place. But I was\r\nadvised to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see me. This is all there is. What d'you think of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's early days. If your heart is as big as your body, and your\r\nsoul as fine as your face, then I'd ask for nothing better,\" said\r\nMcMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"By Gar! you've got an Irish tongue in your head anyhow,\" cried the\r\nsaloon-keeper, not quite certain whether to humour this audacious\r\nvisitor or to stand upon his dignity.\r\n\r\n\"So you are good enough to pass my appearance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"And you were told to see me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Scanlan of Lodge 341, Vermissa. I drink your health\r\nCouncillor, and to our better acquaintance.\" He raised a glass with\r\nwhich he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger as\r\nhe drank it.\r\n\r\nMcGinty, who had been watching him narrowly, raised his thick black\r\neyebrows. \"Oh, it's like that, is it?\" said he. \"I'll have to look a\r\nbit closer into this, Mister--\"\r\n\r\n\"McMurdo.\"\r\n\r\n\"A bit closer, Mr. McMurdo; for we don't take folk on trust in these\r\nparts, nor believe all we're told neither. Come in here for a moment,\r\nbehind the bar.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a small room there, lined with barrels. McGinty carefully\r\nclosed the door, and then seated himself on one of them, biting\r\nthoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those\r\ndisquieting eyes. For a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence.\r\nMcMurdo bore the inspection cheerfully, one hand in his coat pocket,\r\nthe other twisting his brown moustache. Suddenly McGinty stooped and\r\nproduced a wicked-looking revolver.\r\n\r\n\"See here, my joker,\" said he, \"if I thought you were playing any game\r\non us, it would be short work for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a strange welcome,\" McMurdo answered with some dignity, \"for\r\nthe Bodymaster of a lodge of Freemen to give to a stranger brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but it's just that same that you have to prove,\" said McGinty,\r\n\"and God help you if you fail! Where were you made?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lodge 29, Chicago.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"June 24, 1872.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Bodymaster?\"\r\n\r\n\"James H. Scott.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is your district ruler?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bartholomew Wilson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! You seem glib enough in your tests. What are you doing here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Working, the same as you--but a poorer job.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have your back answer quick enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was always quick of speech.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you quick of action?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had that name among those that knew me best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we may try you sooner than you think. Have you heard anything of\r\nthe lodge in these parts?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard that it takes a man to be a brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"True for you, Mr. McMurdo. Why did you leave Chicago?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm damned if I tell you that!\"\r\n\r\nMcGinty opened his eyes. He was not used to being answered in such\r\nfashion, and it amused him. \"Why won't you tell me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because no brother may tell another a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the truth is too bad to tell?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can put it that way if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"See here, mister, you can't expect me, as Bodymaster, to pass into the\r\nlodge a man for whose past he can't answer.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo looked puzzled. Then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an\r\ninner pocket.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't squeal on a fellow?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I'll wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me!\" cried\r\nMcGinty hotly.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Councillor,\" said McMurdo meekly. \"I should apologize.\r\nI spoke without thought. Well, I know that I am safe in your hands.\r\nLook at that clipping.\"\r\n\r\nMcGinty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one Jonas\r\nPinto, in the Lake Saloon, Market Street, Chicago, in the New Year week\r\nof 1874.\r\n\r\n\"Your work?\" he asked, as he handed back the paper.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you shoot him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was helping Uncle Sam to make dollars. Maybe mine were not as good\r\ngold as his, but they looked as well and were cheaper to make. This man\r\nPinto helped me to shove the queer--\"\r\n\r\n\"To do what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it means to pass the dollars out into circulation. Then he said\r\nhe would split. Maybe he did split. I didn't wait to see. I just killed\r\nhim and lighted out for the coal country.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the coal country?\"\r\n\r\n\"'Cause I'd read in the papers that they weren't too particular in\r\nthose parts.\"\r\n\r\nMcGinty laughed. \"You were first a coiner and then a murderer, and you\r\ncame to these parts because you thought you'd be welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about the size of it,\" McMurdo answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess you'll go far. Say, can you make those dollars yet?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo took half a dozen from his pocket. \"Those never passed the\r\nPhiladelphia mint,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"You don't say!\" McGinty held them to the light in his enormous hand,\r\nwhich was hairy as a gorilla's. \"I can see no difference. Gar! you'll\r\nbe a mighty useful brother, I'm thinking! We can do with a bad man or\r\ntwo among us, Friend McMurdo: for there are times when we have to take\r\nour own part. We'd soon be against the wall if we didn't shove back at\r\nthose that were pushing us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I'll do my share of shoving with the rest of the boys.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to have a good nerve. You didn't squirm when I shoved this\r\ngun at you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not me that was in danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was you, Councillor.\" McMurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side\r\npocket of his peajacket. \"I was covering you all the time. I guess my\r\nshot would have been as quick as yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Gar!\" McGinty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of\r\nlaughter. \"Say, we've had no such holy terror come to hand this many a\r\nyear. I reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you.... Well, what\r\nthe hell do you want? And can't I speak alone with a gentleman for five\r\nminutes but you must butt in on us?\"\r\n\r\nThe bartender stood abashed. \"I'm sorry, Councillor, but it's Ted\r\nBaldwin. He says he must see you this very minute.\"\r\n\r\nThe message was unnecessary; for the set, cruel face of the man himself\r\nwas looking over the servant's shoulder. He pushed the bartender out\r\nand closed the door on him.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" said he with a furious glance at McMurdo, \"you got here first,\r\ndid you? I've a word to say to you, Councillor, about this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then say it here and now before my face,\" cried McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"I'll say it at my own time, in my own way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut! Tut!\" said McGinty, getting off his barrel. \"This will never do.\r\nWe have a new brother here, Baldwin, and it's not for us to greet him\r\nin such fashion. Hold out your hand, man, and make it up!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" cried Baldwin in a fury.\r\n\r\n\"I've offered to fight him if he thinks I have wronged him,\" said\r\nMcMurdo. \"I'll fight him with fists, or, if that won't satisfy him,\r\nI'll fight him any other way he chooses. Now, I'll leave it to you,\r\nCouncillor, to judge between us as a Bodymaster should.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"A young lady. She's free to choose for herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she?\" cried Baldwin.\r\n\r\n\"As between two brothers of the lodge I should say that she was,\" said\r\nthe Boss.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's your ruling, is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is, Ted Baldwin,\" said McGinty, with a wicked stare. \"Is it\r\nyou that would dispute it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in\r\nfavour of a man that you never saw before in your life? You're not\r\nBodymaster for life, Jack McGinty, and by God! when next it comes to a\r\nvote--\"\r\n\r\nThe Councillor sprang at him like a tiger. His hand closed round the\r\nother's neck, and he hurled him back across one of the barrels. In his\r\nmad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if McMurdo had not\r\ninterfered.\r\n\r\n\"Easy, Councillor! For heaven's sake, go easy!\" he cried, as he dragged\r\nhim back.\r\n\r\nMcGinty released his hold, and Baldwin, cowed and shaken gasping for\r\nbreath, and shivering in every limb, as one who has looked over the\r\nvery edge of death, sat up on the barrel over which he had been hurled.\r\n\r\n\"You've been asking for it this many a day, Ted Baldwin--now you've got\r\nit!\" cried McGinty, his huge chest rising and falling. \"Maybe you think\r\nif I was voted down from Bodymaster you would find yourself in my\r\nshoes. It's for the lodge to say that. But so long as I am the chief\r\nI'll have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing against you,\" mumbled Baldwin, feeling his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" cried the other, relapsing in a moment into a bluff\r\njoviality, \"we are all good friends again and there's an end of the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\nHe took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the\r\ncork.\r\n\r\n\"See now,\" he continued, as he filled three high glasses. \"Let us drink\r\nthe quarrelling toast of the lodge. After that, as you know, there can\r\nbe no bad blood between us. Now, then the left hand on the apple of my\r\nthroat. I say to you, Ted Baldwin, what is the offense, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"The clouds are heavy,\" answered Baldwin\r\n\r\n\"But they will forever brighten.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this I swear!\"\r\n\r\nThe men drank their glasses, and the same ceremony was performed\r\nbetween Baldwin and McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"There!\" cried McGinty, rubbing his hands. \"That's the end of the black\r\nblood. You come under lodge discipline if it goes further, and that's a\r\nheavy hand in these parts, as Brother Baldwin knows--and as you will\r\ndamn soon find out, Brother McMurdo, if you ask for trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, I'd be slow to do that,\" said McMurdo. He held out his hand to\r\nBaldwin. \"I'm quick to quarrel and quick to forgive. It's my hot Irish\r\nblood, they tell me. But it's over for me, and I bear no grudge.\"\r\n\r\nBaldwin had to take the proffered hand, for the baleful eye of the\r\nterrible Boss was upon him. But his sullen face showed how little the\r\nwords of the other had moved him.\r\n\r\nMcGinty clapped them both on the shoulders. \"Tut! These girls! These\r\ngirls!\" he cried. \"To think that the same petticoats should come\r\nbetween two of my boys! It's the devil's own luck! Well, it's the\r\ncolleen inside of them that must settle the question for it's outside\r\nthe jurisdiction of a Bodymaster--and the Lord be praised for that! We\r\nhave enough on us, without the women as well. You'll have to be\r\naffiliated to Lodge 341, Brother McMurdo. We have our own ways and\r\nmethods, different from Chicago. Saturday night is our meeting, and if\r\nyou come then, we'll make you free forever of the Vermissa Valley.\"\r\n\nOn the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting\r\nevents, McMurdo moved his lodgings from old Jacob Shafter's and took up\r\nhis quarters at the Widow MacNamara's on the extreme outskirts of the\r\ntown. Scanlan, his original acquaintance aboard the train, had occasion\r\nshortly afterwards to move into Vermissa, and the two lodged together.\r\nThere was no other boarder, and the hostess was an easy-going old\r\nIrishwoman who left them to themselves; so that they had a freedom for\r\nspeech and action welcome to men who had secrets in common.\r\n\r\nShafter had relented to the extent of letting McMurdo come to his meals\r\nthere when he liked; so that his intercourse with Ettie was by no means\r\nbroken. On the contrary, it drew closer and more intimate as the weeks\r\nwent by.\r\n\r\nIn his bedroom at his new abode McMurdo felt it safe to take out the\r\ncoining moulds, and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of brothers\r\nfrom the lodge were allowed to come in and see them, each carrying away\r\nin his pocket some examples of the false money, so cunningly struck\r\nthat there was never the slightest difficulty or danger in passing it.\r\nWhy, with such a wonderful art at his command, McMurdo should\r\ncondescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to his companions;\r\nthough he made it clear to anyone who asked him that if he lived\r\nwithout any visible means it would very quickly bring the police upon\r\nhis track.\r\n\r\nOne policeman was indeed after him already; but the incident, as luck\r\nwould have it, did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm.\r\nAfter the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not\r\nfind his way to McGinty's saloon, there to make closer acquaintance\r\nwith \"the boys,\" which was the jovial title by which the dangerous gang\r\nwho infested the place were known to one another. His dashing manner\r\nand fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all; while\r\nthe rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his antagonist in\r\nan \"all in\" bar-room scrap earned the respect of that rough community.\r\nAnother incident, however, raised him even higher in their estimation.\r\n\r\nJust at the crowded hour one night, the door opened and a man entered\r\nwith the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police. This was\r\na special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to supplement\r\nthe efforts of the ordinary civil police, who were perfectly helpless\r\nin the face of the organized ruffianism which terrorized the district.\r\nThere was a hush as he entered, and many a curious glance was cast at\r\nhim; but the relations between policemen and criminals are peculiar in\r\nsome parts of the States, and McGinty himself standing behind his\r\ncounter, showed no surprise when the policeman enrolled himself among\r\nhis customers.\r\n\r\n\"A straight whisky, for the night is bitter,\" said the police officer.\r\n\"I don't think we have met before, Councillor?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be the new captain?\" said McGinty.\r\n\r\n\"That's so. We're looking to you, Councillor, and to the other leading\r\ncitizens, to help us in upholding law and order in this township.\r\nCaptain Marvin is my name.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd do better without you, Captain Marvin,\" said McGinty coldly; \"for\r\nwe have our own police of the township, and no need for any imported\r\ngoods. What are you but the paid tool of the capitalists, hired by them\r\nto club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, we won't argue about that,\" said the police officer\r\ngood-humouredly. \"I expect we all do our duty same as we see it; but we\r\ncan't all see it the same.\" He had drunk off his glass and had turned\r\nto go, when his eyes fell upon the face of Jack McMurdo, who was\r\nscowling at his elbow. \"Hullo! Hullo!\" he cried, looking him up and\r\ndown. \"Here's an old acquaintance!\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrank away from him. \"I was never a friend to you nor any\r\nother cursed copper in my life,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"An acquaintance isn't always a friend,\" said the police captain,\r\ngrinning. \"You're Jack McMurdo of Chicago, right enough, and don't you\r\ndeny it!\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \"I'm not denying it,\" said he. \"D'ye\r\nthink I'm ashamed of my own name?\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got good cause to be, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil d'you mean by that?\" he roared with his fists clenched.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Jack, bluster won't do with me. I was an officer in Chicago\r\nbefore ever I came to this darned coal bunker, and I know a Chicago\r\ncrook when I see one.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo's face fell. \"Don't tell me that you're Marvin of the Chicago\r\nCentral!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Just the same old Teddy Marvin, at your service. We haven't forgotten\r\nthe shooting of Jonas Pinto up there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never shot him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not? That's good impartial evidence, ain't it? Well, his death\r\ncame in uncommon handy for you, or they would have had you for shoving\r\nthe queer. Well, we can let that be bygones; for, between you and\r\nme--and perhaps I'm going further than my duty in saying it--they could\r\nget no clear case against you, and Chicago's open to you to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm very well where I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've given you the pointer, and you're a sulky dog not to thank\r\nme for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose you mean well, and I do thank you,\" said McMurdo in no\r\nvery gracious manner.\r\n\r\n\"It's mum with me so long as I see you living on the straight,\" said\r\nthe captain. \"But, by the Lord! if you get off after this, it's another\r\nstory! So good-night to you--and goodnight, Councillor.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the bar-room; but not before he had created a local hero.\r\nMcMurdo's deeds in far Chicago had been whispered before. He had put\r\noff all questions with a smile, as one who did not wish to have\r\ngreatness thrust upon him. But now the thing was officially confirmed.\r\nThe bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily by the hand.\r\nHe was free of the community from that time on. He could drink hard and\r\nshow little trace of it; but that evening, had his mate Scanlan not\r\nbeen at hand to lead him home, the feted hero would surely have spent\r\nhis night under the bar.\r\n\r\nOn a Saturday night McMurdo was introduced to the lodge. He had thought\r\nto pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of Chicago; but there\r\nwere particular rites in Vermissa of which they were proud, and these\r\nhad to be undergone by every postulant. The assembly met in a large\r\nroom reserved for such purposes at the Union House. Some sixty members\r\nassembled at Vermissa; but that by no means represented the full\r\nstrength of the organization, for there were several other lodges in\r\nthe valley, and others across the mountains on each side, who exchanged\r\nmembers when any serious business was afoot, so that a crime might be\r\ndone by men who were strangers to the locality. Altogether there were\r\nnot less than five hundred scattered over the coal district.\r\n\r\nIn the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table. At\r\nthe side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses, on which some\r\nmembers of the company were already turning their eyes. McGinty sat at\r\nthe head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of tangled black\r\nhair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so that he seemed to\r\nbe a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual. To right and left of\r\nhim were the higher lodge officials, the cruel, handsome face of Ted\r\nBaldwin among them. Each of these wore some scarf or medallion as\r\nemblem of his office.\r\n\r\nThey were, for the most part, men of mature age; but the rest of the\r\ncompany consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five, the\r\nready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their seniors.\r\nAmong the older men were many whose features showed the tigerish,\r\nlawless souls within; but looking at the rank and file it was difficult\r\nto believe that these eager and open-faced young fellows were in very\r\ntruth a dangerous gang of murderers, whose minds had suffered such\r\ncomplete moral perversion that they took a horrible pride in their\r\nproficiency at the business, and looked with deepest respect at the man\r\nwho had the reputation of making what they called \"a clean job.\"\r\n\r\nTo their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous\r\nthing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured\r\nthem, and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives. The\r\ncrime committed, they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the\r\nfatal blow, and amused one another and the company by describing the\r\ncries and contortions of the murdered man.\r\n\r\nAt first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements; but at the\r\ntime which this narrative describes their proceedings were\r\nextraordinarily open, for the repeated failures of the law had proved\r\nto them that, on the one hand, no one would dare to witness against\r\nthem, and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch witnesses\r\nupon whom they could call, and a well-filled treasure chest from which\r\nthey could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent in the state.\r\nIn ten long years of outrage there had been no single conviction, and\r\nthe only danger that ever threatened the Scowrers lay in the victim\r\nhimself--who, however outnumbered and taken by surprise, might and\r\noccasionally did leave his mark upon his assailants.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him; but no one\r\nwould tell him in what it consisted. He was led now into an outer room\r\nby two solemn brothers. Through the plank partition he could hear the\r\nmurmur of many voices from the assembly within. Once or twice he caught\r\nthe sound of his own name, and he knew that they were discussing his\r\ncandidacy. Then there entered an inner guard with a green and gold sash\r\nacross his chest.\r\n\r\n\"The Bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed, blinded, and entered,\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nThe three of them removed his coat, turned up the sleeve of his right\r\narm, and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it fast.\r\nThey next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the upper\r\npart of his face, so that he could see nothing. He was then led into\r\nthe assembly hall.\r\n\r\nIt was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood. He heard the\r\nrustle and murmur of the people round him, and then the voice of\r\nMcGinty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears.\r\n\r\n\"John McMurdo,\" said the voice, \"are you already a member of the\r\nAncient Order of Freemen?\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed in assent.\r\n\r\n\"Is your lodge No. 29, Chicago?\"\r\n\r\nHe bowed again.\r\n\r\n\"Dark nights are unpleasant,\" said the voice.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for strangers to travel,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"The clouds are heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a storm is approaching.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the brethren satisfied?\" asked the Bodymaster.\r\n\r\nThere was a general murmur of assent.\r\n\r\n\"We know, Brother, by your sign and by your countersign that you are\r\nindeed one of us,\" said McGinty. \"We would have you know, however, that\r\nin this county and in other counties of these parts we have certain\r\nrites, and also certain duties of our own which call for good men. Are\r\nyou ready to be tested?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you of stout heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take a stride forward to prove it.\"\r\n\r\nAs the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes,\r\npressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move forward\r\nwithout a danger of losing them. None the less, he nerved himself to\r\nstep resolutely out, and as he did so the pressure melted away. There\r\nwas a low murmur of applause.\r\n\r\n\"He is of stout heart,\" said the voice. \"Can you bear pain?\"\r\n\r\n\"As well as another,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Test him!\"\r\n\r\nIt was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out, for an\r\nagonizing pain shot through his forearm. He nearly fainted at the\r\nsudden shock of it; but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide\r\nhis agony.\r\n\r\n\"I can take more than that,\" said he.\r\n\r\nThis time there was loud applause. A finer first appearance had never\r\nbeen made in the lodge. Hands clapped him on the back, and the hood was\r\nplucked from his head. He stood blinking and smiling amid the\r\ncongratulations of the brothers.\r\n\r\n\"One last word, Brother McMurdo,\" said McGinty. \"You have already sworn\r\nthe oath of secrecy and fidelity, and you are aware that the punishment\r\nfor any breach of it is instant and inevitable death?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"And you accept the rule of the Bodymaster for the time being under all\r\ncircumstances?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in the name of Lodge 341, Vermissa, I welcome you to its\r\nprivileges and debates. You will put the liquor on the table, Brother\r\nScanlan, and we will drink to our worthy brother.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo's coat had been brought to him; but before putting it on he\r\nexamined his right arm, which still smarted heavily. There on the flesh\r\nof the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it, deep and red, as\r\nthe branding iron had left it. One or two of his neighbours pulled up\r\ntheir sleeves and showed their own lodge marks.\r\n\r\n\"We've all had it,\" said one; \"but not all as brave as you over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut! It was nothing,\" said he; but it burned and ached all the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all been\r\ndisposed of, the business of the lodge proceeded. McMurdo, accustomed\r\nonly to the prosaic performances of Chicago, listened with open ears\r\nand more surprise than he ventured to show to what followed.\r\n\r\n\"The first business on the agenda paper,\" said McGinty, \"is to read the\r\nfollowing letter from Division Master Windle of Merton County Lodge\r\n249. He says:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n       \"There is a job to be done on Andrew Rae of Rae &\r\n     Sturmash, coal owners near this place. You will remember\r\n     that your lodge owes us a return, having had the service of\r\n     two brethren in the matter of the patrolman last fall. You\r\n     will send two good men, they will be taken charge of by\r\n     Treasurer Higgins of this lodge, whose address you know.\r\n     He will show them when to act and where. Yours in freedom,\r\n\r\n                                   \"J. W. WINDLE D. M. A. O. F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the\r\nloan of a man or two, and it is not for us to refuse him.\" McGinty\r\npaused and looked round the room with his dull, malevolent eyes. \"Who\r\nwill volunteer for the job?\"\r\n\r\nSeveral young fellows held up their hands. The Bodymaster looked at\r\nthem with an approving smile.\r\n\r\n\"You'll do, Tiger Cormac. If you handle it as well as you did the last,\r\nyou won't be wrong. And you, Wilson.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've no pistol,\" said the volunteer, a mere boy in his teens.\r\n\r\n\"It's your first, is it not? Well, you have to be blooded some time. It\r\nwill be a great start for you. As to the pistol, you'll find it waiting\r\nfor you, or I'm mistaken. If you report yourselves on Monday, it will\r\nbe time enough. You'll get a great welcome when you return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any reward this time?\" asked Cormac, a thick-set, dark-faced,\r\nbrutal-looking young man, whose ferocity had earned him the nickname of\r\n\"Tiger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the reward. You just do it for the honour of the thing.\r\nMaybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom of\r\nthe box.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has the man done?\" asked young Wilson.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, it's not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done. He\r\nhas been judged over there. That's no business of ours. All we have to\r\ndo is to carry it out for them, same as they would for us. Speaking of\r\nthat, two brothers from the Merton lodge are coming over to us next\r\nweek to do some business in this quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\" asked someone.\r\n\r\n\"Faith, it is wiser not to ask. If you know nothing, you can testify\r\nnothing, and no trouble can come of it. But they are men who will make\r\na clean job when they are about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And time, too!\" cried Ted Baldwin. \"Folk are gettin' out of hand in\r\nthese parts. It was only last week that three of our men were turned\r\noff by Foreman Blaker. It's been owing him a long time, and he'll get\r\nit full and proper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get what?\" McMurdo whispered to his neighbour.\r\n\r\n\"The business end of a buckshot cartridge!\" cried the man with a loud\r\nlaugh. \"What think you of our ways, Brother?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo's criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of\r\nthe vile association of which he was now a member. \"I like it well,\"\r\nsaid he. \"'Tis a proper place for a lad of mettle.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" cried the black-maned Bodymaster from the end of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis our new brother, sir, who finds our ways to his taste.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo rose to his feet for an instant. \"I would say, Eminent\r\nBodymaster, that if a man should be wanted I should take it as an\r\nhonour to be chosen to help the lodge.\"\r\n\r\nThere was great applause at this. It was felt that a new sun was\r\npushing its rim above the horizon. To some of the elders it seemed that\r\nthe progress was a little too rapid.\r\n\r\n\"I would move,\" said the secretary, Harraway, a vulture-faced old\r\ngraybeard who sat near the chairman, \"that Brother McMurdo should wait\r\nuntil it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, that was what I meant; I'm in your hands,\" said McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"Your time will come, Brother,\" said the chairman. \"We have marked you\r\ndown as a willing man, and we believe that you will do good work in\r\nthese parts. There is a small matter to-night in which you may take a\r\nhand if it so please you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will wait for something that is worth while.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can come to-night, anyhow, and it will help you to know what we\r\nstand for in this community. I will make the announcement later.\r\nMeanwhile,\" he glanced at his agenda paper, \"I have one or two more\r\npoints to bring before the meeting. First of all, I will ask the\r\ntreasurer as to our bank balance. There is the pension to Jim\r\nCarnaway's widow. He was struck down doing the work of the lodge, and\r\nit is for us to see that she is not the loser.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jim was shot last month when they tried to kill Chester Wilcox of\r\nMarley Creek,\" McMurdo's neighbour informed him.\r\n\r\n\"The funds are good at the moment,\" said the treasurer, with the\r\nbankbook in front of him. \"The firms have been generous of late. Max\r\nLinder & Co. paid five hundred to be left alone. Walker Brothers sent\r\nin a hundred; but I took it on myself to return it and ask for five. If\r\nI do not hear by Wednesday, their winding gear may get out of order. We\r\nhad to burn their breaker last year before they became reasonable. Then\r\nthe West Section Coaling Company has paid its annual contribution. We\r\nhave enough on hand to meet any obligations.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about Archie Swindon?\" asked a brother.\r\n\r\n\"He has sold out and left the district. The old devil left a note for\r\nus to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in New York\r\nthan a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers. By\r\nGar! it was as well that he made a break for it before the note reached\r\nus! I guess he won't show his face in this valley again.\"\r\n\r\nAn elderly, clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose\r\nfrom the end of the table which faced the chairman. \"Mr. Treasurer,\" he\r\nasked, \"may I ask who has bought the property of this man that we have\r\ndriven out of the district?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Brother Morris. It has been bought by the State & Merton County\r\nRailroad Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who bought the mines of Todman and of Lee that came into the\r\nmarket in the same way last year?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same company, Brother Morris.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who bought the ironworks of Manson and of Shuman and of Van Deher\r\nand of Atwood, which have all been given up of late?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were all bought by the West Gilmerton General Mining Company.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see, Brother Morris,\" said the chairman, \"that it matters to\r\nus who buys them, since they can't carry them out of the district.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all respect to you, Eminent Bodymaster, I think it may matter\r\nvery much to us. This process has been going on now for ten long years.\r\nWe are gradually driving all the small men out of trade. What is the\r\nresult? We find in their places great companies like the Railroad or\r\nthe General Iron, who have their directors in New York or Philadelphia,\r\nand care nothing for our threats. We can take it out of their local\r\nbosses, but it only means that others will be sent in their stead. And\r\nwe are making it dangerous for ourselves. The small men could not harm\r\nus. They had not the money nor the power. So long as we did not squeeze\r\nthem too dry, they would stay on under our power. But if these big\r\ncompanies find that we stand between them and their profits, they will\r\nspare no pains and no expense to hunt us down and bring us to court.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a hush at these ominous words, and every face darkened as\r\ngloomy looks were exchanged. So omnipotent and unchallenged had they\r\nbeen that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the\r\nbackground had been banished from their minds. And yet the idea struck\r\na chill to the most reckless of them.\r\n\r\n\"It is my advice,\" the speaker continued, \"that we go easier upon the\r\nsmall men. On the day that they have all been driven out the power of\r\nthis society will have been broken.\"\r\n\r\nUnwelcome truths are not popular. There were angry cries as the speaker\r\nresumed his seat. McGinty rose with gloom upon his brow.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Morris,\" said he, \"you were always a croaker. So long as the\r\nmembers of this lodge stand together there is no power in the United\r\nStates that can touch them. Sure, have we not tried it often enough in\r\nthe law courts? I expect the big companies will find it easier to pay\r\nthan to fight, same as the little companies do. And now, Brethren,\"\r\nMcGinty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he spoke, \"this\r\nlodge has finished its business for the evening, save for one small\r\nmatter which may be mentioned when we are parting. The time has now\r\ncome for fraternal refreshment and for harmony.\"\r\n\r\nStrange indeed is human nature. Here were these men, to whom murder was\r\nfamiliar, who again and again had struck down the father of the family,\r\nsome man against whom they had no personal feeling, without one thought\r\nof compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or helpless\r\nchildren, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move them to\r\ntears. McMurdo had a fine tenor voice, and if he had failed to gain the\r\ngood will of the lodge before, it could no longer have been withheld\r\nafter he had thrilled them with \"I'm Sitting on the Stile, Mary,\" and\r\n\"On the Banks of Allan Water.\"\r\n\r\nIn his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the\r\nmost popular of the brethren, marked already for advancement and high\r\noffice. There were other qualities needed, however, besides those of\r\ngood fellowship, to make a worthy Freeman, and of these he was given an\r\nexample before the evening was over. The whisky bottle had passed round\r\nmany times, and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when their\r\nBodymaster rose once more to address them.\r\n\r\n\"Boys,\" said he, \"there's one man in this town that wants trimming up,\r\nand it's for you to see that he gets it. I'm speaking of James Stanger\r\nof the Herald. You've seen how he's been opening his mouth against us\r\nagain?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of assent, with many a muttered oath. McGinty took a\r\nslip of paper from his waistcoat pocket.\r\n\r\n                     \"LAW AND ORDER!\r\n\r\nThat's how he heads it.\r\n\r\n       \"REIGN OF TERROR IN THE COAL AND IRON DISTRICT\r\n\r\n     \"Twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations\r\n   which proved the existence of a criminal organization in our\r\n   midst. From that day these outrages have never ceased, until\r\n   now they have reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium\r\n   of the civilized world. Is it for such results as this that\r\n   our great country welcomes to its bosom the alien who flies\r\n   from the despotisms of Europe? Is it that they shall\r\n   themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given\r\n   them shelter, and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness\r\n   should be established under the very shadow of the sacred\r\n   folds of the starry Flag of Freedom which would raise horror\r\n   in our minds if we read of it as existing under the most\r\n   effete monarchy of the East? The men are known. The organization\r\n   is patent and public. How long are we to endure it? Can we\r\n   forever live--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I've read enough of the slush!\" cried the chairman, tossing the\r\npaper down upon the table. \"That's what he says of us. The question I'm\r\nasking you is what shall we say to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kill him!\" cried a dozen fierce voices.\r\n\r\n\"I protest against that,\" said Brother Morris, the man of the good brow\r\nand shaved face. \"I tell you, Brethren, that our hand is too heavy in\r\nthis valley, and that there will come a point where in self-defense\r\nevery man will unite to crush us out. James Stanger is an old man. He\r\nis respected in the township and the district. His paper stands for all\r\nthat is solid in the valley. If that man is struck down, there will be\r\na stir through this state that will only end with our destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how would they bring about our destruction, Mr. Standback?\" cried\r\nMcGinty. \"Is it by the police? Sure, half of them are in our pay and\r\nhalf of them afraid of us. Or is it by the law courts and the judge?\r\nHaven't we tried that before now, and what ever came of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a Judge Lynch that might try the case,\" said Brother Morris.\r\n\r\nA general shout of anger greeted the suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"I have but to raise my finger,\" cried McGinty, \"and I could put two\r\nhundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end.\"\r\nThen suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into a\r\nterrible frown, \"See here, Brother Morris, I have my eye on you, and\r\nhave had for some time! You've no heart yourself, and you try to take\r\nthe heart out of others. It will be an ill day for you, Brother Morris,\r\nwhen your own name comes on our agenda paper, and I'm thinking that\r\nit's just there that I ought to place it.\"\r\n\r\nMorris had turned deadly pale, and his knees seemed to give way under\r\nhim as he fell back into his chair. He raised his glass in his\r\ntrembling hand and drank before he could answer. \"I apologize, Eminent\r\nBodymaster, to you and to every brother in this lodge if I have said\r\nmore than I should. I am a faithful member--you all know that--and it\r\nis my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me speak in anxious\r\nwords. But I have greater trust in your judgment than in my own,\r\nEminent Bodymaster, and I promise you that I will not offend again.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bodymaster's scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words.\r\n\"Very good, Brother Morris. It's myself that would be sorry if it were\r\nneedful to give you a lesson. But so long as I am in this chair we\r\nshall be a united lodge in word and in deed. And now, boys,\" he\r\ncontinued, looking round at the company, \"I'll say this much, that if\r\nStanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need\r\nask for. These editors hang together, and every journal in the state\r\nwould be crying out for police and troops. But I guess you can give him\r\na pretty severe warning. Will you fix it, Brother Baldwin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure!\" said the young man eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"How many will you take?\"\r\n\r\n\"Half a dozen, and two to guard the door. You'll come, Gower, and you,\r\nMansel, and you, Scanlan, and the two Willabys.\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised the new brother he should go,\" said the chairman.\r\n\r\nTed Baldwin looked at McMurdo with eyes which showed that he had not\r\nforgotten nor forgiven. \"Well, he can come if he wants,\" he said in a\r\nsurly voice. \"That's enough. The sooner we get to work the better.\"\r\n\r\nThe company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken\r\nsong. The bar was still crowded with revellers, and many of the\r\nbrethren remained there. The little band who had been told off for duty\r\npassed out into the street, proceeding in twos and threes along the\r\nsidewalk so as not to provoke attention. It was a bitterly cold night,\r\nwith a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty, star-spangled sky.\r\nThe men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced a high building. The\r\nwords \"Vermissa Herald\" were printed in gold lettering between the\r\nbrightly lit windows. From within came the clanking of the printing\r\npress.\r\n\r\n\"Here, you,\" said Baldwin to McMurdo, \"you can stand below at the door\r\nand see that the road is kept open for us. Arthur Willaby can stay with\r\nyou. You others come with me. Have no fears, boys; for we have a dozen\r\nwitnesses that we are in the Union Bar at this very moment.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly midnight, and the street was deserted save for one or two\r\nrevellers upon their way home. The party crossed the road, and, pushing\r\nopen the door of the newspaper office, Baldwin and his men rushed in\r\nand up the stair which faced them. McMurdo and another remained below.\r\nFrom the room above came a shout, a cry for help, and then the sound of\r\ntrampling feet and of falling chairs. An instant later a gray-haired\r\nman rushed out on the landing.\r\n\r\nHe was seized before he could get farther, and his spectacles came\r\ntinkling down to McMurdo's feet. There was a thud and a groan. He was\r\non his face, and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they\r\nfell upon him. He writhed, and his long, thin limbs quivered under the\r\nblows. The others ceased at last; but Baldwin, his cruel face set in an\r\ninfernal smile, was hacking at the man's head, which he vainly\r\nendeavoured to defend with his arms. His white hair was dabbled with\r\npatches of blood. Baldwin was still stooping over his victim, putting\r\nin a short, vicious blow whenever he could see a part exposed, when\r\nMcMurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back.\r\n\r\n\"You'll kill the man,\" said he. \"Drop it!\"\r\n\r\nBaldwin looked at him in amazement. \"Curse you!\" he cried. \"Who are you\r\nto interfere--you that are new to the lodge? Stand back!\" He raised his\r\nstick; but McMurdo had whipped his pistol out of his hip pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back yourself!\" he cried. \"I'll blow your face in if you lay a\r\nhand on me. As to the lodge, wasn't it the order of the Bodymaster that\r\nthe man was not to be killed--and what are you doing but killing him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's truth he says,\" remarked one of the men.\r\n\r\n\"By Gar! you'd best hurry yourselves!\" cried the man below. \"The\r\nwindows are all lighting up, and you'll have the whole town here inside\r\nof five minutes.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed the sound of shouting in the street, and a little\r\ngroup of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and\r\nnerving itself to action. Leaving the limp and motionless body of the\r\neditor at the head of the stair, the criminals rushed down and made\r\ntheir way swiftly along the street. Having reached the Union House,\r\nsome of them mixed with the crowd in McGinty's saloon, whispering\r\nacross the bar to the Boss that the job had been well carried through.\r\nOthers, and among them McMurdo, broke away into side streets, and so by\r\ndevious paths to their own homes.\r\n\nWhen McMurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his\r\ninitiation into the lodge. His head ached with the effect of the drink,\r\nand his arm, where he had been branded, was hot and swollen. Having his\r\nown peculiar source of income, he was irregular in his attendance at\r\nhis work; so he had a late breakfast, and remained at home for the\r\nmorning writing a long letter to a friend. Afterwards he read the Daily\r\nHerald. In a special column put in at the last moment he read:\r\n\r\n        OUTRAGE AT THE HERALD OFFICE--EDITOR\r\n                   SERIOUSLY INJURED.\r\n\r\nIt was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more\r\nfamiliar than the writer could have been. It ended with the statement:\r\n\r\n      The matter is now in the hands of the police; but it can\r\n    hardly be hoped that their exertions will be attended by any\r\n    better results than in the past. Some of the men were\r\n    recognized, and there is hope that a conviction may be\r\n    obtained. The source of the outrage was, it need hardly be\r\n    said, that infamous society which has held this community\r\n    in bondage for so long a period, and against which the\r\n    Herald has taken so uncompromising a stand. Mr. Stanger's\r\n    many friends will rejoice to hear that, though he has been\r\n    cruelly and brutally beaten, and though he has sustained\r\n    severe injuries about the head, there is no immediate danger\r\n    to his life.\r\n\r\nBelow it stated that a guard of police, armed with Winchester rifles,\r\nhad been requisitioned for the defense of the office.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo had laid down the paper, and was lighting his pipe with a hand\r\nwhich was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening, when there\r\nwas a knock outside, and his landlady brought to him a note which had\r\njust been handed in by a lad. It was unsigned, and ran thus:\r\n\r\n    I should wish to speak to you, but would rather not do so\r\n    in your house. You will find me beside the flagstaff upon\r\n    Miller Hill. If you will come there now, I have something\r\n    which it is important for you to hear and for me to say.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise; for he could not\r\nimagine what it meant or who was the author of it. Had it been in a\r\nfeminine hand, he might have imagined that it was the beginning of one\r\nof those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past life.\r\nBut it was the writing of a man, and of a well educated one, too.\r\nFinally, after some hesitation, he determined to see the matter through.\r\n\r\nMiller Hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the town.\r\nIn summer it is a favourite resort of the people; but in winter it is\r\ndesolate enough. From the top of it one has a view not only of the\r\nwhole straggling, grimy town, but of the winding valley beneath, with\r\nits scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each side of\r\nit, and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until he\r\nreached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer\r\ngaiety. Beside it was a bare flagstaff, and underneath it a man, his\r\nhat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up. When he turned\r\nhis face McMurdo saw that it was Brother Morris, he who had incurred\r\nthe anger of the Bodymaster the night before. The lodge sign was given\r\nand exchanged as they met.\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to have a word with you, Mr. McMurdo,\" said the older man,\r\nspeaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate ground.\r\n\"It was kind of you to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not put your name to the note?\"\r\n\r\n\"One has to be cautious, mister. One never knows in times like these\r\nhow a thing may come back to one. One never knows either who to trust\r\nor who not to trust.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely one may trust brothers of the lodge.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, not always,\" cried Morris with vehemence. \"Whatever we say,\r\neven what we think, seems to go back to that man McGinty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\" said McMurdo sternly. \"It was only last night, as you know\r\nwell, that I swore good faith to our Bodymaster. Would you be asking me\r\nto break my oath?\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is the view you take,\" said Morris sadly, \"I can only say that\r\nI am sorry I gave you the trouble to come and meet me. Things have come\r\nto a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their thoughts to\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo, who had been watching his companion very narrowly, relaxed\r\nsomewhat in his bearing. \"Sure I spoke for myself only,\" said he. \"I am\r\na newcomer, as you know, and I am strange to it all. It is not for me\r\nto open my mouth, Mr. Morris, and if you think well to say anything to\r\nme I am here to hear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to take it back to Boss McGinty!\" said Morris bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, then, you do me injustice there,\" cried McMurdo. \"For myself I\r\nam loyal to the lodge, and so I tell you straight; but I would be a\r\npoor creature if I were to repeat to any other what you might say to me\r\nin confidence. It will go no further than me; though I warn you that\r\nyou may get neither help nor sympathy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given up looking for either the one or the other,\" said Morris.\r\n\"I may be putting my very life in your hands by what I say; but, bad as\r\nyou are--and it seemed to me last night that you were shaping to be as\r\nbad as the worst--still you are new to it, and your conscience cannot\r\nyet be as hardened as theirs. That was why I thought to speak with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what have you to say?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you give me away, may a curse be on you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I said I would not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would ask you, then, when you joined the Freeman's society in\r\nChicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity, did ever it cross your\r\nmind that you might find it would lead you to crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you call it crime,\" McMurdo answered.\r\n\r\n\"Call it crime!\" cried Morris, his voice vibrating with passion. \"You\r\nhave seen little of it if you can call it anything else. Was it crime\r\nlast night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till the\r\nblood dripped from his white hairs? Was that crime--or what else would\r\nyou call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are some would say it was war,\" said McMurdo, \"a war of two\r\nclasses with all in, so that each struck as best it could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, did you think of such a thing when you joined the Freeman's\r\nsociety at Chicago?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'm bound to say I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It was just a benefit club\r\nand a meeting place for one's fellows. Then I heard of this\r\nplace--curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears!--and I\r\ncame to better myself! My God! to better myself! My wife and three\r\nchildren came with me. I started a dry goods store on Market Square,\r\nand I prospered well. The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and\r\nI was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. I've\r\nthe badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my\r\nheart. I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and\r\ncaught in a meshwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said to\r\nmake things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night. I\r\ncan't get away; for all I have in the world is in my store. If I leave\r\nthe society, I know well that it means murder to me, and God knows what\r\nto my wife and children. Oh, man, it is awful--awful!\" He put his hands\r\nto his face, and his body shook with convulsive sobs.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \"You were too soft for the job,\" said\r\nhe. \"You are the wrong sort for such work.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a conscience and a religion; but they made me a criminal among\r\nthem. I was chosen for a job. If I backed down I knew well what would\r\ncome to me. Maybe I'm a coward. Maybe it's the thought of my poor\r\nlittle woman and the children that makes me one. Anyhow I went. I guess\r\nit will haunt me forever.\r\n\r\n\"It was a lonely house, twenty miles from here, over the range yonder.\r\nI was told off for the door, same as you were last night. They could\r\nnot trust me with the job. The others went in. When they came out their\r\nhands were crimson to the wrists. As we turned away a child was\r\nscreaming out of the house behind us. It was a boy of five who had seen\r\nhis father murdered. I nearly fainted with the horror of it, and yet I\r\nhad to keep a bold and smiling face; for well I knew that if I did not\r\nit would be out of my house that they would come next with their bloody\r\nhands and it would be my little Fred that would be screaming for his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\n\"But I was a criminal then, part sharer in a murder, lost forever in\r\nthis world, and lost also in the next. I am a good Catholic; but the\r\npriest would have no word with me when he heard I was a Scowrer, and I\r\nam excommunicated from my faith. That's how it stands with me. And I\r\nsee you going down the same road, and I ask you what the end is to be.\r\nAre you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also, or can we do anything\r\nto stop it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do?\" asked McMurdo abruptly. \"You would not inform?\"\r\n\r\n\"God forbid!\" cried Morris. \"Sure, the very thought would cost me my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's well,\" said McMurdo. \"I'm thinking that you are a weak man and\r\nthat you make too much of the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much! Wait till you have lived here longer. Look down the valley!\r\nSee the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it! I tell you\r\nthat the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that over the\r\nheads of the people. It is the Valley of Fear, the Valley of Death. The\r\nterror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the dawn. Wait,\r\nyoung man, and you will learn for yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll let you know what I think when I have seen more,\" said\r\nMcMurdo carelessly. \"What is very clear is that you are not the man for\r\nthe place, and that the sooner you sell out--if you only get a dime a\r\ndollar for what the business is worth--the better it will be for you.\r\nWhat you have said is safe with me; but, by Gar! if I thought you were\r\nan informer--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" cried Morris piteously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, let it rest at that. I'll bear what you have said in mind, and\r\nmaybe some day I'll come back to it. I expect you meant kindly by\r\nspeaking to me like this. Now I'll be getting home.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word before you go,\" said Morris. \"We may have been seen together.\r\nThey may want to know what we have spoken about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that's well thought of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I offer you a clerkship in my store.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I refuse it. That's our business. Well, so long, Brother Morris,\r\nand may you find things go better with you in the future.\"\r\n\r\nThat same afternoon, as McMurdo sat smoking, lost in thought beside the\r\nstove of his sitting-room, the door swung open and its framework was\r\nfilled with the huge figure of Boss McGinty. He passed the sign, and\r\nthen seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him\r\nsteadily for some time, a look which was as steadily returned.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not much of a visitor, Brother McMurdo,\" he said at last. \"I guess\r\nI am too busy over the folk that visit me. But I thought I'd stretch a\r\npoint and drop down to see you in your own house.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm proud to see you here, Councillor,\" McMurdo answered heartily,\r\nbringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard. \"It's an honour that I\r\nhad not expected.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's the arm?\" asked the Boss.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo made a wry face. \"Well, I'm not forgetting it,\" he said; \"but\r\nit's worth it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's worth it,\" the other answered, \"to those that are loyal and\r\ngo through with it and are a help to the lodge. What were you speaking\r\nto Brother Morris about on Miller Hill this morning?\"\r\n\r\nThe question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer\r\nprepared. He burst into a hearty laugh. \"Morris didn't know I could\r\nearn a living here at home. He shan't know either; for he has got too\r\nmuch conscience for the likes of me. But he's a good-hearted old chap.\r\nIt was his idea that I was at a loose end, and that he would do me a\r\ngood turn by offering me a clerkship in a dry goods store.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that was it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you refused it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure. Couldn't I earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four\r\nhours' work?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so. But I wouldn't get about too much with Morris.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess because I tell you not. That's enough for most folk in\r\nthese parts.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be enough for most folk; but it ain't enough for me,\r\nCouncillor,\" said McMurdo boldly. \"If you are a judge of men, you'll\r\nknow that.\"\r\n\r\nThe swarthy giant glared at him, and his hairy paw closed for an\r\ninstant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his\r\ncompanion. Then he laughed in his loud, boisterous, insincere fashion.\r\n\r\n\"You're a queer card, for sure,\" said he. \"Well, if you want reasons,\r\nI'll give them. Did Morris say nothing to you against the lodge?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor against me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's because he daren't trust you. But in his heart he is not\r\na loyal brother. We know that well. So we watch him and we wait for the\r\ntime to admonish him. I'm thinking that the time is drawing near.\r\nThere's no room for scabby sheep in our pen. But if you keep company\r\nwith a disloyal man, we might think that you were disloyal, too. See?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no chance of my keeping company with him; for I dislike the\r\nman,\" McMurdo answered. \"As to being disloyal, if it was any man but\r\nyou he would not use the word to me twice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's enough,\" said McGinty, draining off his glass. \"I came\r\ndown to give you a word in season, and you've had it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to know,\" said McMurdo, \"how you ever came to learn that I\r\nhad spoken with Morris at all?\"\r\n\r\nMcGinty laughed. \"It's my business to know what goes on in this\r\ntownship,\" said he. \"I guess you'd best reckon on my hearing all that\r\npasses. Well, time's up, and I'll just say--\"\r\n\r\nBut his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion. With a\r\nsudden crash the door flew open, and three frowning, intent faces\r\nglared in at them from under the peaks of police caps. McMurdo sprang\r\nto his feet and half drew his revolver; but his arm stopped midway as\r\nhe became conscious that two Winchester rifles were levelled at his\r\nhead. A man in uniform advanced into the room, a six-shooter in his\r\nhand. It was Captain Marvin, once of Chicago, and now of the Mine\r\nConstabulary. He shook his head with a half-smile at McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you'd be getting into trouble, Mr. Crooked McMurdo of\r\nChicago,\" said he. \"Can't keep out of it, can you? Take your hat and\r\ncome along with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you'll pay for this, Captain Marvin,\" said McGinty. \"Who are\r\nyou, I'd like to know, to break into a house in this fashion and molest\r\nhonest, law-abiding men?\"\r\n\r\n\"You're standing out in this deal, Councillor McGinty,\" said the police\r\ncaptain. \"We are not out after you, but after this man McMurdo. It is\r\nfor you to help, not to hinder us in our duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a friend of mine, and I'll answer for his conduct,\" said the\r\nBoss.\r\n\r\n\"By all accounts, Mr. McGinty, you may have to answer for your own\r\nconduct some of these days,\" the captain answered. \"This man McMurdo\r\nwas a crook before ever he came here, and he's a crook still. Cover\r\nhim, Patrolman, while I disarm him.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's my pistol,\" said McMurdo coolly. \"Maybe, Captain Marvin, if\r\nyou and I were alone and face to face you would not take me so easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's your warrant?\" asked McGinty. \"By Gar! a man might as well\r\nlive in Russia as in Vermissa while folk like you are running the\r\npolice. It's a capitalist outrage, and you'll hear more of it, I\r\nreckon.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do what you think is your duty the best way you can, Councillor.\r\nWe'll look after ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"What am I accused of?\" asked McMurdo.\r\n\r\n\"Of being concerned in the beating of old Editor Stanger at the Herald\r\noffice. It wasn't your fault that it isn't a murder charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if that's all you have against him,\" cried McGinty with a laugh,\r\n\"you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right now. This\r\nman was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight, and I can\r\nbring a dozen to prove it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your affair, and I guess you can settle it in court to-morrow.\r\nMeanwhile, come on, McMurdo, and come quietly if you don't want a gun\r\nacross your head. You stand wide, Mr. McGinty; for I warn you I will\r\nstand no resistance when I am on duty!\"\r\n\r\nSo determined was the appearance of the captain that both McMurdo and\r\nhis boss were forced to accept the situation. The latter managed to\r\nhave a few whispered words with the prisoner before they parted.\r\n\r\n\"What about--\" he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining plant.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" whispered McMurdo, who had devised a safe hiding place\r\nunder the floor.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bid you good-bye,\" said the Boss, shaking hands. \"I'll see Reilly\r\nthe lawyer and take the defense upon myself. Take my word for it that\r\nthey won't be able to hold you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't bet on that. Guard the prisoner, you two, and shoot him if\r\nhe tries any games. I'll search the house before I leave.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so; but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant. When\r\nhe had descended he and his men escorted McMurdo to headquarters.\r\nDarkness had fallen, and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the\r\nstreets were nearly deserted; but a few loiterers followed the group,\r\nand emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"Lynch the cursed Scowrer!\" they cried. \"Lynch him!\" They laughed and\r\njeered as he was pushed into the police station. After a short, formal\r\nexamination from the inspector in charge he was put into the common\r\ncell. Here he found Baldwin and three other criminals of the night\r\nbefore, all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial next\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nBut even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the\r\nFreemen was able to extend. Late at night there came a jailer with a\r\nstraw bundle for their bedding, out of which he extracted two bottles\r\nof whisky, some glasses, and a pack of cards. They spent a hilarious\r\nnight, without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning.\r\n\r\nNor had they cause, as the result was to show. The magistrate could not\r\npossibly, on the evidence, have held them for a higher court. On the\r\none hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that the\r\nlight was uncertain, that they were themselves much perturbed, and that\r\nit was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the assailants;\r\nalthough they believed that the accused were among them. Cross examined\r\nby the clever attorney who had been engaged by McGinty, they were even\r\nmore nebulous in their evidence.\r\n\r\nThe injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise by\r\nthe suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond the\r\nfact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache. He added that\r\nhe knew them to be Scowrers, since no one else in the community could\r\npossibly have any enmity to him, and he had long been threatened on\r\naccount of his outspoken editorials. On the other hand, it was clearly\r\nshown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six citizens, including\r\nthat high municipal official, Councillor McGinty, that the men had been\r\nat a card party at the Union House until an hour very much later than\r\nthe commission of the outrage.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say that they were discharged with something very near to\r\nan apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had been\r\nput, together with an implied censure of Captain Marvin and the police\r\nfor their officious zeal.\r\n\r\nThe verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which McMurdo\r\nsaw many familiar faces. Brothers of the lodge smiled and waved. But\r\nthere were others who sat with compressed lips and brooding eyes as the\r\nmen filed out of the dock. One of them, a little, dark-bearded,\r\nresolute fellow, put the thoughts of himself and comrades into words as\r\nthe ex-prisoners passed him.\r\n\r\n\"You damned murderers!\" he said. \"We'll fix you yet!\"\r\n\nIf anything had been needed to give an impetus to Jack McMurdo's\r\npopularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and\r\nacquittal. That a man on the very night of joining the lodge should\r\nhave done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new\r\nrecord in the annals of the society. Already he had earned the\r\nreputation of a good boon companion, a cheery reveller, and withal a\r\nman of high temper, who would not take an insult even from the\r\nall-powerful Boss himself. But in addition to this he impressed his\r\ncomrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose\r\nbrain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme, or whose hand would\r\nbe more capable of carrying it out. \"He'll be the boy for the clean\r\njob,\" said the oldsters to one another, and waited their time until\r\nthey could set him to his work.\r\n\r\nMcGinty had instruments enough already; but he recognized that this was\r\na supremely able one. He felt like a man holding a fierce bloodhound in\r\nleash. There were curs to do the smaller work; but some day he would\r\nslip this creature upon its prey. A few members of the lodge, Ted\r\nBaldwin among them, resented the rapid rise of the stranger and hated\r\nhim for it; but they kept clear of him, for he was as ready to fight as\r\nto laugh.\r\n\r\nBut if he gained favour with his fellows, there was another quarter,\r\none which had become even more vital to him, in which he lost it. Ettie\r\nShafter's father would have nothing more to do with him, nor would he\r\nallow him to enter the house. Ettie herself was too deeply in love to\r\ngive him up altogether, and yet her own good sense warned her of what\r\nwould come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as a criminal.\r\n\r\nOne morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him, possibly\r\nfor the last time, and make one strong endeavour to draw him from those\r\nevil influences which were sucking him down. She went to his house, as\r\nhe had often begged her to do, and made her way into the room which he\r\nused as his sitting-room. He was seated at a table, with his back\r\nturned and a letter in front of him. A sudden spirit of girlish\r\nmischief came over her--she was still only nineteen. He had not heard\r\nher when she pushed open the door. Now she tiptoed forward and laid her\r\nhand lightly upon his bended shoulders.\r\n\r\nIf she had expected to startle him, she certainly succeeded; but only\r\nin turn to be startled herself. With a tiger spring he turned on her,\r\nand his right hand was feeling for her throat. At the same instant with\r\nthe other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him. For an\r\ninstant he stood glaring. Then astonishment and joy took the place of\r\nthe ferocity which had convulsed his features--a ferocity which had\r\nsent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had never\r\nbefore intruded into her gentle life.\r\n\r\n\"It's you!\" said he, mopping his brow. \"And to think that you should\r\ncome to me, heart of my heart, and I should find nothing better to do\r\nthan to want to strangle you! Come then, darling,\" and he held out his\r\narms, \"let me make it up to you.\"\r\n\r\nBut she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear which\r\nshe had read in the man's face. All her woman's instinct told her that\r\nit was not the mere fright of a man who is startled. Guilt--that was\r\nit--guilt and fear!\r\n\r\n\"What's come over you, Jack?\" she cried. \"Why were you so scared of me?\r\nOh, Jack, if your conscience was at ease, you would not have looked at\r\nme like that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, I was thinking of other things, and when you came tripping so\r\nlightly on those fairy feet of yours--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, it was more than that, Jack.\" Then a sudden suspicion seized\r\nher. \"Let me see that letter you were writing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Ettie, I couldn't do that.\"\r\n\r\nHer suspicions became certainties. \"It's to another woman,\" she cried.\r\n\"I know it! Why else should you hold it from me? Was it to your wife\r\nthat you were writing? How am I to know that you are not a married\r\nman--you, a stranger, that nobody knows?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not married, Ettie. See now, I swear it! You're the only one\r\nwoman on earth to me. By the cross of Christ I swear it!\"\r\n\r\nHe was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but\r\nbelieve him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" she cried, \"why will you not show me the letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you, acushla,\" said he. \"I'm under oath not to show it, and\r\njust as I wouldn't break my word to you so I would keep it to those who\r\nhold my promise. It's the business of the lodge, and even to you it's\r\nsecret. And if I was scared when a hand fell on me, can't you\r\nunderstand it when it might have been the hand of a detective?\"\r\n\r\nShe felt that he was telling the truth. He gathered her into his arms\r\nand kissed away her fears and doubts.\r\n\r\n\"Sit here by me, then. It's a queer throne for such a queen; but it's\r\nthe best your poor lover can find. He'll do better for you some of\r\nthese days, I'm thinking. Now your mind is easy once again, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"How can it ever be at ease, Jack, when I know that you are a criminal\r\namong criminals, when I never know the day that I may hear you are in\r\ncourt for murder? 'McMurdo the Scowrer,' that's what one of our\r\nboarders called you yesterday. It went through my heart like a knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, hard words break no bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they were true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, dear, it's not so bad as you think. We are but poor men that are\r\ntrying in our own way to get our rights.\"\r\n\r\nEttie threw her arms round her lover's neck. \"Give it up, Jack! For my\r\nsake, for God's sake, give it up! It was to ask you that I came here\r\nto-day. Oh, Jack, see--I beg it of you on my bended knees! Kneeling\r\nhere before you I implore you to give it up!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, my darlin', you don't know what it is you are asking. How could\r\nI give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my\r\ncomrades? If you could see how things stand with me you could never ask\r\nit of me. Besides, if I wanted to, how could I do it? You don't suppose\r\nthat the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've thought of that, Jack. I've planned it all. Father has saved some\r\nmoney. He is weary of this place where the fear of these people darkens\r\nour lives. He is ready to go. We would fly together to Philadelphia or\r\nNew York, where we would be safe from them.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed. \"The lodge has a long arm. Do you think it could not\r\nstretch from here to Philadelphia or New York?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, to the West, or to England, or to Germany, where father\r\ncame from--anywhere to get away from this Valley of Fear!\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo thought of old Brother Morris. \"Sure, it is the second time I\r\nhave heard the valley so named,\" said he. \"The shadow does indeed seem\r\nto lie heavy on some of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It darkens every moment of our lives. Do you suppose that Ted Baldwin\r\nhas ever forgiven us? If it were not that he fears you, what do you\r\nsuppose our chances would be? If you saw the look in those dark, hungry\r\neyes of his when they fall on me!\"\r\n\r\n\"By Gar! I'd teach him better manners if I caught him at it! But see\r\nhere, little girl. I can't leave here. I can't--take that from me once\r\nand for all. But if you will leave me to find my own way, I will try to\r\nprepare a way of getting honourably out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no honour in such a matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, it's just how you look at it. But if you'll give me six\r\nmonths, I'll work it so that I can leave without being ashamed to look\r\nothers in the face.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed with joy. \"Six months!\" she cried. \"Is it a promise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it may be seven or eight. But within a year at the furthest we\r\nwill leave the valley behind us.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the most that Ettie could obtain, and yet it was something.\r\nThere was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate\r\nfuture. She returned to her father's house more light-hearted than she\r\nhad ever been since Jack McMurdo had come into her life.\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that as a member, all the doings of the society\r\nwould be told to him; but he was soon to discover that the organization\r\nwas wider and more complex than the simple lodge. Even Boss McGinty was\r\nignorant as to many things; for there was an official named the County\r\nDelegate, living at Hobson's Patch farther down the line, who had power\r\nover several different lodges which he wielded in a sudden and\r\narbitrary way. Only once did McMurdo see him, a sly, little gray-haired\r\nrat of a man, with a slinking gait and a sidelong glance which was\r\ncharged with malice. Evans Pott was his name, and even the great Boss\r\nof Vermissa felt towards him something of the repulsion and fear which\r\nthe huge Danton may have felt for the puny but dangerous Robespierre.\r\n\r\nOne day Scanlan, who was McMurdo's fellow boarder, received a note from\r\nMcGinty inclosing one from Evans Pott, which informed him that he was\r\nsending over two good men, Lawler and Andrews, who had instructions to\r\nact in the neighbourhood; though it was best for the cause that no\r\nparticulars as to their objects should be given. Would the Bodymaster\r\nsee to it that suitable arrangements be made for their lodgings and\r\ncomfort until the time for action should arrive? McGinty added that it\r\nwas impossible for anyone to remain secret at the Union House, and\r\nthat, therefore, he would be obliged if McMurdo and Scanlan would put\r\nthe strangers up for a few days in their boarding house.\r\n\r\nThe same evening the two men arrived, each carrying his gripsack.\r\nLawler was an elderly man, shrewd, silent, and self-contained, clad in\r\nan old black frock coat, which with his soft felt hat and ragged,\r\ngrizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant preacher.\r\nHis companion Andrews was little more than a boy, frank-faced and\r\ncheerful, with the breezy manner of one who is out for a holiday and\r\nmeans to enjoy every minute of it. Both men were total abstainers, and\r\nbehaved in all ways as exemplary members of the society, with the one\r\nsimple exception that they were assassins who had often proved\r\nthemselves to be most capable instruments for this association of\r\nmurder. Lawler had already carried out fourteen commissions of the\r\nkind, and Andrews three.\r\n\r\nThey were, as McMurdo found, quite ready to converse about their deeds\r\nin the past, which they recounted with the half-bashful pride of men\r\nwho had done good and unselfish service for the community. They were\r\nreticent, however, as to the immediate job in hand.\r\n\r\n\"They chose us because neither I nor the boy here drink,\" Lawler\r\nexplained. \"They can count on us saying no more than we should. You\r\nmust not take it amiss, but it is the orders of the County Delegate\r\nthat we obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, we are all in it together,\" said Scanlan, McMurdo's mate, as the\r\nfour sat together at supper.\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough, and we'll talk till the cows come home of the\r\nkilling of Charlie Williams or of Simon Bird, or any other job in the\r\npast. But till the work is done we say nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are half a dozen about here that I have a word to say to,\" said\r\nMcMurdo, with an oath. \"I suppose it isn't Jack Knox of Ironhill that\r\nyou are after. I'd go some way to see him get his deserts.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not him yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Herman Strauss?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, nor him either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you won't tell us we can't make you; but I'd be glad to know.\"\r\n\r\nLawler smiled and shook his head. He was not to be drawn.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reticence of their guests, Scanlan and McMurdo were\r\nquite determined to be present at what they called \"the fun.\" When,\r\ntherefore, at an early hour one morning McMurdo heard them creeping\r\ndown the stairs he awakened Scanlan, and the two hurried on their\r\nclothes. When they were dressed they found that the others had stolen\r\nout, leaving the door open behind them. It was not yet dawn, and by the\r\nlight of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down the\r\nstreet. They followed them warily, treading noiselessly in the deep\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nThe boarding house was near the edge of the town, and soon they were at\r\nthe crossroads which is beyond its boundary. Here three men were\r\nwaiting, with whom Lawler and Andrews held a short, eager conversation.\r\nThen they all moved on together. It was clearly some notable job which\r\nneeded numbers. At this point there are several trails which lead to\r\nvarious mines. The strangers took that which led to the Crow Hill, a\r\nhuge business which was in strong hands which had been able, thanks to\r\ntheir energetic and fearless New England manager, Josiah H. Dunn, to\r\nkeep some order and discipline during the long reign of terror.\r\n\r\nDay was breaking now, and a line of workmen were slowly making their\r\nway, singly and in groups, along the blackened path.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo and Scanlan strolled on with the others, keeping in sight of\r\nthe men whom they followed. A thick mist lay over them, and from the\r\nheart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle. It was the\r\nten-minute signal before the cages descended and the day's labour began.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a\r\nhundred miners waiting, stamping their feet and blowing on their\r\nfingers; for it was bitterly cold. The strangers stood in a little\r\ngroup under the shadow of the engine house. Scanlan and McMurdo climbed\r\na heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them. They saw the\r\nmine engineer, a great bearded Scotchman named Menzies, come out of the\r\nengine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be lowered.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant a tall, loose-framed young man with a clean-shaved,\r\nearnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head. As he came forward\r\nhis eyes fell upon the group, silent and motionless, under the engine\r\nhouse. The men had drawn down their hats and turned up their collars to\r\nscreen their faces. For a moment the presentiment of Death laid its\r\ncold hand upon the manager's heart. At the next he had shaken it off\r\nand saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers.\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\" he asked as he advanced. \"What are you loitering there\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no answer; but the lad Andrews stepped forward and shot him\r\nin the stomach. The hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and\r\nhelpless as if they were paralyzed. The manager clapped his two hands\r\nto the wound and doubled himself up. Then he staggered away; but\r\nanother of the assassins fired, and he went down sidewise, kicking and\r\nclawing among a heap of clinkers. Menzies, the Scotchman, gave a roar\r\nof rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the murderers;\r\nbut was met by two balls in the face which dropped him dead at their\r\nvery feet.\r\n\r\nThere was a surge forward of some of the miners, and an inarticulate\r\ncry of pity and of anger; but a couple of the strangers emptied their\r\nsix-shooters over the heads of the crowd, and they broke and scattered,\r\nsome of them rushing wildly back to their homes in Vermissa.\r\n\r\nWhen a few of the bravest had rallied, and there was a return to the\r\nmine, the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning, without\r\na single witness being able to swear to the identity of these men who\r\nin front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double crime.\r\n\r\nScanlan and McMurdo made their way back; Scanlan somewhat subdued, for\r\nit was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes, and it\r\nappeared less funny than he had been led to believe. The horrible\r\nscreams of the dead manager's wife pursued them as they hurried to the\r\ntown. McMurdo was absorbed and silent; but he showed no sympathy for\r\nthe weakening of his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, it is like a war,\" he repeated. \"What is it but a war between us\r\nand them, and we hit back where we best can.\"\r\n\r\nThere was high revel in the lodge room at the Union House that night,\r\nnot only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the Crow Hill\r\nmine, which would bring this organization into line with the other\r\nblackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district, but also\r\nover a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of the lodge\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that when the County Delegate had sent over five good\r\nmen to strike a blow in Vermissa, he had demanded that in return three\r\nVermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to kill\r\nWilliam Hales of Stake Royal, one of the best known and most popular\r\nmine owners in the Gilmerton district, a man who was believed not to\r\nhave an enemy in the world; for he was in all ways a model employer. He\r\nhad insisted, however, upon efficiency in the work, and had, therefore,\r\npaid off certain drunken and idle employees who were members of the\r\nall-powerful society. Coffin notices hung outside his door had not\r\nweakened his resolution, and so in a free, civilized country he found\r\nhimself condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThe execution had now been duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled\r\nnow in the seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of the\r\nparty. His flushed face and glazed, blood-shot eyes told of\r\nsleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades had spent the night\r\nbefore among the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-stained. But\r\nno heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer\r\nwelcome from their comrades.\r\n\r\nThe story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of\r\nlaughter. They had waited for their man as he drove home at nightfall,\r\ntaking their station at the top of a steep hill, where his horse must\r\nbe at a walk. He was so furred to keep out the cold that he could not\r\nlay his hand on his pistol. They had pulled him out and shot him again\r\nand again. He had screamed for mercy. The screams were repeated for the\r\namusement of the lodge.\r\n\r\n\"Let's hear again how he squealed,\" they cried.\r\n\r\nNone of them knew the man; but there is eternal drama in a killing, and\r\nthey had shown the Scowrers of Gilmerton that the Vermissa men were to\r\nbe relied upon.\r\n\r\nThere had been one contretemps; for a man and his wife had driven up\r\nwhile they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body. It\r\nhad been suggested that they should shoot them both; but they were\r\nharmless folk who were not connected with the mines, so they were\r\nsternly bidden to drive on and keep silent, lest a worse thing befall\r\nthem. And so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to all\r\nsuch hard-hearted employers, and the three noble avengers had hurried\r\noff into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to the very\r\nedge of the furnaces and the slag heaps. Here they were, safe and\r\nsound, their work well done, and the plaudits of their companions in\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\nIt had been a great day for the Scowrers. The shadow had fallen even\r\ndarker over the valley. But as the wise general chooses the moment of\r\nvictory in which to redouble his efforts, so that his foes may have no\r\ntime to steady themselves after disaster, so Boss McGinty, looking out\r\nupon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious eyes,\r\nhad devised a new attack upon those who opposed him. That very night,\r\nas the half-drunken company broke up, he touched McMurdo on the arm and\r\nled him aside into that inner room where they had their first interview.\r\n\r\n\"See here, my lad,\" said he, \"I've got a job that's worthy of you at\r\nlast. You'll have the doing of it in your own hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proud I am to hear it,\" McMurdo answered.\r\n\r\n\"You can take two men with you--Manders and Reilly. They have been\r\nwarned for service. We'll never be right in this district until Chester\r\nWilcox has been settled, and you'll have the thanks of every lodge in\r\nthe coal fields if you can down him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my best, anyhow. Who is he, and where shall I find him?\"\r\n\r\nMcGinty took his eternal half-chewed, half-smoked cigar from the corner\r\nof his mouth, and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page torn from\r\nhis notebook.\r\n\r\n\"He's the chief foreman of the Iron Dike Company. He's a hard citizen,\r\nan old colour sergeant of the war, all scars and grizzle. We've had two\r\ntries at him; but had no luck, and Jim Carnaway lost his life over it.\r\nNow it's for you to take it over. That's the house--all alone at the\r\nIron Dike crossroad, same as you see here on the map--without another\r\nwithin earshot. It's no good by day. He's armed and shoots quick and\r\nstraight, with no questions asked. But at night--well, there he is with\r\nhis wife, three children, and a hired help. You can't pick or choose.\r\nIt's all or none. If you could get a bag of blasting powder at the\r\nfront door with a slow match to it--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the man done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you he shot Jim Carnaway?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did he shoot him?\"\r\n\r\n\"What in thunder has that to do with you? Carnaway was about his house\r\nat night, and he shot him. That's enough for me and you. You've got to\r\nsettle the thing right.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's these two women and the children. Do they go up too?\"\r\n\r\n\"They have to--else how can we get him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems hard on them; for they've done nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of fool's talk is this? Do you back out?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy, Councillor, easy! What have I ever said or done that you should\r\nthink I would be after standing back from an order of the Bodymaster of\r\nmy own lodge? If it's right or if it's wrong, it's for you to decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I will do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"When?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you had best give me a night or two that I may see the house and\r\nmake my plans. Then--\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said McGinty, shaking him by the hand. \"I leave it with\r\nyou. It will be a great day when you bring us the news. It's just the\r\nlast stroke that will bring them all to their knees.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so\r\nsuddenly placed in his hands. The isolated house in which Chester\r\nWilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley. That very\r\nnight he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt. It was\r\ndaylight before he returned from his reconnaissance. Next day he\r\ninterviewed his two subordinates, Manders and Reilly, reckless\r\nyoungsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt.\r\n\r\nTwo nights later they met outside the town, all three armed, and one of\r\nthem carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the\r\nquarries. It was two in the morning before they came to the lonely\r\nhouse. The night was a windy one, with broken clouds drifting swiftly\r\nacross the face of a three-quarter moon. They had been warned to be on\r\ntheir guard against bloodhounds; so they moved forward cautiously, with\r\ntheir pistols cocked in their hands. But there was no sound save the\r\nhowling of the wind, and no movement but the swaying branches above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo listened at the door of the lonely house; but all was still\r\nwithin. Then he leaned the powder bag against it, ripped a hole in it\r\nwith his knife, and attached the fuse. When it was well alight he and\r\nhis two companions took to their heels, and were some distance off,\r\nsafe and snug in a sheltering ditch, before the shattering roar of the\r\nexplosion, with the low, deep rumble of the collapsing building, told\r\nthem that their work was done. No cleaner job had ever been carried out\r\nin the bloodstained annals of the society.\r\n\r\nBut alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should all\r\nhave gone for nothing! Warned by the fate of the various victims, and\r\nknowing that he was marked down for destruction, Chester Wilcox had\r\nmoved himself and his family only the day before to some safer and less\r\nknown quarters, where a guard of police should watch over them. It was\r\nan empty house which had been torn down by the gunpowder, and the grim\r\nold colour sergeant of the war was still teaching discipline to the\r\nminers of Iron Dike.\r\n\r\n\"Leave him to me,\" said McMurdo. \"He's my man, and I'll get him sure if\r\nI have to wait a year for him.\"\r\n\r\nA vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge, and so for\r\nthe time the matter ended. When a few weeks later it was reported in\r\nthe papers that Wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade, it was an\r\nopen secret that McMurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job.\r\n\r\nSuch were the methods of the Society of Freemen, and such were the\r\ndeeds of the Scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over the\r\ngreat and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by their\r\nterrible presence. Why should these pages be stained by further crimes?\r\nHave I not said enough to show the men and their methods?\r\n\r\nThese deeds are written in history, and there are records wherein one\r\nmay read the details of them. There one may learn of the shooting of\r\nPolicemen Hunt and Evans because they had ventured to arrest two\r\nmembers of the society--a double outrage planned at the Vermissa lodge\r\nand carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed men. There\r\nalso one may read of the shooting of Mrs. Larbey when she was nursing\r\nher husband, who had been beaten almost to death by orders of Boss\r\nMcGinty. The killing of the elder Jenkins, shortly followed by that of\r\nhis brother, the mutilation of James Murdoch, the blowing up of the\r\nStaphouse family, and the murder of the Stendals all followed hard upon\r\none another in the same terrible winter.\r\n\r\nDarkly the shadow lay upon the Valley of Fear. The spring had come with\r\nrunning brooks and blossoming trees. There was hope for all Nature\r\nbound so long in an iron grip; but nowhere was there any hope for the\r\nmen and women who lived under the yoke of the terror. Never had the\r\ncloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early summer of\r\nthe year 1875.\r\n\nIt was the height of the reign of terror. McMurdo, who had already been\r\nappointed Inner Deacon, with every prospect of some day succeeding\r\nMcGinty as Bodymaster, was now so necessary to the councils of his\r\ncomrades that nothing was done without his help and advice. The more\r\npopular he became, however, with the Freemen, the blacker were the\r\nscowls which greeted him as he passed along the streets of Vermissa. In\r\nspite of their terror the citizens were taking heart to band themselves\r\ntogether against their oppressors. Rumours had reached the lodge of\r\nsecret gatherings in the Herald office and of distribution of firearms\r\namong the law-abiding people. But McGinty and his men were undisturbed\r\nby such reports. They were numerous, resolute, and well armed. Their\r\nopponents were scattered and powerless. It would all end, as it had\r\ndone in the past, in aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests. So\r\nsaid McGinty, McMurdo, and all the bolder spirits.\r\n\r\nIt was a Saturday evening in May. Saturday was always the lodge night,\r\nand McMurdo was leaving his house to attend it when Morris, the weaker\r\nbrother of the order, came to see him. His brow was creased with care,\r\nand his kindly face was drawn and haggard.\r\n\r\n\"Can I speak with you freely, Mr. McMurdo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't forget that I spoke my heart to you once, and that you kept it\r\nto yourself, even though the Boss himself came to ask you about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What else could I do if you trusted me? It wasn't that I agreed with\r\nwhat you said.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that well. But you are the one that I can speak to and be safe.\r\nI've a secret here,\" he put his hand to his breast, \"and it is just\r\nburning the life out of me. I wish it had come to any one of you but\r\nme. If I tell it, it will mean murder, for sure. If I don't, it may\r\nbring the end of us all. God help me, but I am near out of my wits over\r\nit!\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo looked at the man earnestly. He was trembling in every limb. He\r\npoured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him. \"That's the\r\nphysic for the likes of you,\" said he. \"Now let me hear of it.\"\r\n\r\nMorris drank, and his white face took a tinge of colour. \"I can tell it\r\nto you all in one sentence,\" said he. \"There's a detective on our\r\ntrail.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo stared at him in astonishment. \"Why, man, you're crazy,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Isn't the place full of police and detectives and what harm did\r\nthey ever do us?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, it's no man of the district. As you say, we know them, and it\r\nis little that they can do. But you've heard of Pinkerton's?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've read of some folk of that name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you can take it from me you've no show when they are on your\r\ntrail. It's not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern. It's a dead\r\nearnest business proposition that's out for results and keeps out till\r\nby hook or crook it gets them. If a Pinkerton man is deep in this\r\nbusiness, we are all destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must kill him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, it's the first thought that came to you! So it will be up at the\r\nlodge. Didn't I say to you that it would end in murder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, what is murder? Isn't it common enough in these parts?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed; but it's not for me to point out the man that is to be\r\nmurdered. I'd never rest easy again. And yet it's our own necks that\r\nmay be at stake. In God's name what shall I do?\" He rocked to and fro\r\nin his agony of indecision.\r\n\r\nBut his words had moved McMurdo deeply. It was easy to see that he\r\nshared the other's opinion as to the danger, and the need for meeting\r\nit. He gripped Morris's shoulder and shook him in his earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"See here, man,\" he cried, and he almost screeched the words in his\r\nexcitement, \"you won't gain anything by sitting keening like an old\r\nwife at a wake. Let's have the facts. Who is the fellow? Where is he?\r\nHow did you hear of him? Why did you come to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I came to you; for you are the one man that would advise me. I told\r\nyou that I had a store in the East before I came here. I left good\r\nfriends behind me, and one of them is in the telegraph service. Here's\r\na letter that I had from him yesterday. It's this part from the top of\r\nthe page. You can read it yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThis was what McMurdo read:\r\n\r\n    How are the Scowrers getting on in your parts? We read\r\n    plenty of them in the papers. Between you and me I expect\r\n    to hear news from you before long. Five big corporations\r\n    and the two railroads have taken the thing up in dead\r\n    earnest. They mean it, and you can bet they'll get there!\r\n    They are right deep down into it. Pinkerton has taken hold\r\n    under their orders, and his best man, Birdy Edwards, is\r\n    operating. The thing has got to be stopped right now.\r\n\r\n\"Now read the postscript.\"\r\n\r\n      Of course, what I give you is what I learned in business;\r\n    so it goes no further. It's a queer cipher that you handle by\r\n    the yard every day and can get no meaning from.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo sat in silence for some time, with the letter in his listless\r\nhands. The mist had lifted for a moment, and there was the abyss before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Does anyone else know of this?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have told no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this man--your friend--has he any other person that he would be\r\nlikely to write to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I dare say he knows one or two more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of the lodge?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's likely enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was asking because it is likely that he may have given some\r\ndescription of this fellow Birdy Edwards--then we could get on his\r\ntrail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's possible. But I should not think he knew him. He is just\r\ntelling me the news that came to him by way of business. How would he\r\nknow this Pinkerton man?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo gave a violent start.\r\n\r\n\"By Gar!\" he cried, \"I've got him. What a fool I was not to know it.\r\nLord! but we're in luck! We will fix him before he can do any harm. See\r\nhere, Morris, will you leave this thing in my hands?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, if you will only take it off mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do that. You can stand right back and let me run it. Even your\r\nname need not be mentioned. I'll take it all on myself, as if it were\r\nto me that this letter has come. Will that content you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just what I would ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then leave it at that and keep your head shut. Now I'll get down to\r\nthe lodge, and we'll soon make old man Pinkerton sorry for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't kill this man?\"\r\n\r\n\"The less you know, Friend Morris, the easier your conscience will be,\r\nand the better you will sleep. Ask no questions, and let these things\r\nsettle themselves. I have hold of it now.\"\r\n\r\nMorris shook his head sadly as he left. \"I feel that his blood is on my\r\nhands,\" he groaned.\r\n\r\n\"Self-protection is no murder, anyhow,\" said McMurdo, smiling grimly.\r\n\"It's him or us. I guess this man would destroy us all if we left him\r\nlong in the valley. Why, Brother Morris, we'll have to elect you\r\nBodymaster yet; for you've surely saved the lodge.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously of\r\nthis new intrusion than his words would show. It may have been his\r\nguilty conscience, it may have been the reputation of the Pinkerton\r\norganization, it may have been the knowledge that great, rich\r\ncorporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the Scowrers;\r\nbut, whatever his reason, his actions were those of a man who is\r\npreparing for the worst. Every paper which would incriminate him was\r\ndestroyed before he left the house. After that he gave a long sigh of\r\nsatisfaction; for it seemed to him that he was safe. And yet the danger\r\nmust still have pressed somewhat upon him; for on his way to the lodge\r\nhe stopped at old man Shafter's. The house was forbidden him; but when\r\nhe tapped at the window Ettie came out to him. The dancing Irish\r\ndeviltry had gone from her lover's eyes. She read his danger in his\r\nearnest face.\r\n\r\n\"Something has happened!\" she cried. \"Oh, Jack, you are in danger!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, it is not very bad, my sweetheart. And yet it may be wise that\r\nwe make a move before it is worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make a move?\"\r\n\r\n\"I promised you once that I would go some day. I think the time is\r\ncoming. I had news to-night, bad news, and I see trouble coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"The police?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn't know what that is, acushla,\r\nnor what it may mean to the likes of me. I'm too deep in this thing,\r\nand I may have to get out of it quick. You said you would come with me\r\nif I went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jack, it would be the saving of you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm an honest man in some things, Ettie. I wouldn't hurt a hair of\r\nyour bonny head for all that the world can give, nor ever pull you down\r\none inch from the golden throne above the clouds where I always see\r\nyou. Would you trust me?\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand in his without a word. \"Well, then, listen to what I\r\nsay, and do as I order you, for indeed it's the only way for us. Things\r\nare going to happen in this valley. I feel it in my bones. There may be\r\nmany of us that will have to look out for ourselves. I'm one, anyhow.\r\nIf I go, by day or night, it's you that must come with me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd come after you, Jack.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, you shall come with me. If this valley is closed to me and I\r\ncan never come back, how can I leave you behind, and me perhaps in\r\nhiding from the police with never a chance of a message? It's with me\r\nyou must come. I know a good woman in the place I come from, and it's\r\nthere I'd leave you till we can get married. Will you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Jack, I will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you for your trust in me! It's a fiend out of hell that I\r\nshould be if I abused it. Now, mark you, Ettie, it will be just a word\r\nto you, and when it reaches you, you will drop everything and come\r\nright down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till I come\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Day or night, I'll come at the word, Jack.\"\r\n\r\nSomewhat eased in mind, now that his own preparations for escape had\r\nbeen begun, McMurdo went on to the lodge. It had already assembled, and\r\nonly by complicated signs and counter-signs could he pass through the\r\nouter guard and inner guard who close-tiled it. A buzz of pleasure and\r\nwelcome greeted him as he entered. The long room was crowded, and\r\nthrough the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled black mane of the\r\nBodymaster, the cruel, unfriendly features of Baldwin, the vulture face\r\nof Harraway, the secretary, and a dozen more who were among the leaders\r\nof the lodge. He rejoiced that they should all be there to take counsel\r\nover his news.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it's glad we are to see you, Brother!\" cried the chairman.\r\n\"There's business here that wants a Solomon in judgment to set it\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's Lander and Egan,\" explained his neighbour as he took his seat.\r\n\"They both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting of\r\nold man Crabbe over at Stylestown, and who's to say which fired the\r\nbullet?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo rose in his place and raised his hand. The expression of his\r\nface froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n\"Eminent Bodymaster,\" he said, in a solemn voice, \"I claim urgency!\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother McMurdo claims urgency,\" said McGinty. \"It's a claim that by\r\nthe rules of this lodge takes precedence. Now Brother, we attend you.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo took the letter from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Eminent Bodymaster and Brethren,\" he said, \"I am the bearer of ill\r\nnews this day; but it is better that it should be known and discussed,\r\nthan that a blow should fall upon us without warning which would\r\ndestroy us all. I have information that the most powerful and richest\r\norganizations in this state have bound themselves together for our\r\ndestruction, and that at this very moment there is a Pinkerton\r\ndetective, one Birdy Edwards, at work in the valley collecting the\r\nevidence which may put a rope round the necks of many of us, and send\r\nevery man in this room into a felon's cell. That is the situation for\r\nthe discussion of which I have made a claim of urgency.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence in the room. It was broken by the chairman.\r\n\r\n\"What is your evidence for this, Brother McMurdo?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is in this letter which has come into my hands,\" said McMurdo. He\r\nread the passage aloud. \"It is a matter of honour with me that I can\r\ngive no further particulars about the letter, nor put it into your\r\nhands; but I assure you that there is nothing else in it which can\r\naffect the interests of the lodge. I put the case before you as it has\r\nreached me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me say, Mr. Chairman,\" said one of the older brethren, \"that I\r\nhave heard of Birdy Edwards, and that he has the name of being the best\r\nman in the Pinkerton service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does anyone know him by sight?\" asked McGinty.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said McMurdo, \"I do.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a murmur of astonishment through the hall.\r\n\r\n\"I believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands,\" he continued with\r\nan exulting smile upon his face. \"If we act quickly and wisely, we can\r\ncut this thing short. If I have your confidence and your help, it is\r\nlittle that we have to fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we to fear, anyhow? What can he know of our affairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might say so if all were as stanch as you, Councillor. But this\r\nman has all the millions of the capitalists at his back. Do you think\r\nthere is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be\r\nbought? He will get at our secrets--maybe has got them already. There's\r\nonly one sure cure.\"\r\n\r\n\"That he never leaves the valley,\" said Baldwin.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo nodded. \"Good for you, Brother Baldwin,\" he said. \"You and I\r\nhave had our differences, but you have said the true word to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he, then? Where shall we know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eminent Bodymaster,\" said McMurdo, earnestly, \"I would put it to you\r\nthat this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge. God\r\nforbid that I should throw a doubt on anyone here; but if so much as a\r\nword of gossip got to the ears of this man, there would be an end of\r\nany chance of our getting him. I would ask the lodge to choose a trusty\r\ncommittee, Mr. Chairman--yourself, if I might suggest it, and Brother\r\nBaldwin here, and five more. Then I can talk freely of what I know and\r\nof what I advise should be done.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposition was at once adopted, and the committee chosen. Besides\r\nthe chairman and Baldwin there were the vulture-faced secretary,\r\nHarraway, Tiger Cormac, the brutal young assassin, Carter, the\r\ntreasurer, and the brothers Willaby, fearless and desperate men who\r\nwould stick at nothing.\r\n\r\nThe usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued: for there was a\r\ncloud upon the men's spirits, and many there for the first time began\r\nto see the cloud of avenging Law drifting up in that serene sky under\r\nwhich they had dwelt so long. The horrors they had dealt out to others\r\nhad been so much a part of their settled lives that the thought of\r\nretribution had become a remote one, and so seemed the more startling\r\nnow that it came so closely upon them. They broke up early and left\r\ntheir leaders to their council.\r\n\r\n\"Now, McMurdo!\" said McGinty when they were alone. The seven men sat\r\nfrozen in their seats.\r\n\r\n\"I said just now that I knew Birdy Edwards,\" McMurdo explained. \"I need\r\nnot tell you that he is not here under that name. He's a brave man, but\r\nnot a crazy one. He passes under the name of Steve Wilson, and he is\r\nlodging at Hobson's Patch.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I fell into talk with him. I thought little of it at the time,\r\nnor would have given it a second thought but for this letter; but now\r\nI'm sure it's the man. I met him on the cars when I went down the line\r\non Wednesday--a hard case if ever there was one. He said he was a\r\nreporter. I believed it for the moment. Wanted to know all he could\r\nabout the Scowrers and what he called 'the outrages' for a New York\r\npaper. Asked me every kind of question so as to get something. You bet\r\nI was giving nothing away. 'I'd pay for it and pay well,' said he, 'if\r\nI could get some stuff that would suit my editor.' I said what I\r\nthought would please him best, and he handed me a twenty-dollar bill\r\nfor my information. 'There's ten times that for you,' said he, 'if you\r\ncan find me all that I want.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you tell him, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Any stuff I could make up.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know he wasn't a newspaper man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you. He got out at Hobson's Patch, and so did I. I chanced\r\ninto the telegraph bureau, and he was leaving it.\r\n\r\n\"'See here,' said the operator after he'd gone out, 'I guess we should\r\ncharge double rates for this.'--'I guess you should,' said I. He had\r\nfilled the form with stuff that might have been Chinese, for all we\r\ncould make of it. 'He fires a sheet of this off every day,' said the\r\nclerk. 'Yes,' said I; 'it's special news for his paper, and he's scared\r\nthat the others should tap it.' That was what the operator thought and\r\nwhat I thought at the time; but I think differently now.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Gar! I believe you are right,\" said McGinty. \"But what do you allow\r\nthat we should do about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not go right down now and fix him?\" someone suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, the sooner the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd start this next minute if I knew where we could find him,\" said\r\nMcMurdo. \"He's in Hobson's Patch; but I don't know the house. I've got\r\na plan, though, if you'll only take my advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go to the Patch to-morrow morning. I'll find him through the\r\noperator. He can locate him, I guess. Well, then I'll tell him that I'm\r\na Freeman myself. I'll offer him all the secrets of the lodge for a\r\nprice. You bet he'll tumble to it. I'll tell him the papers are at my\r\nhouse, and that it's as much as my life would be worth to let him come\r\nwhile folk were about. He'll see that that's horse sense. Let him come\r\nat ten o'clock at night, and he shall see everything. That will fetch\r\nhim sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"You can plan the rest for yourselves. Widow MacNamara's is a lonely\r\nhouse. She's as true as steel and as deaf as a post. There's only\r\nScanlan and me in the house. If I get his promise--and I'll let you\r\nknow if I do--I'd have the whole seven of you come to me by nine\r\no'clock. We'll get him in. If ever he gets out alive--well, he can talk\r\nof Birdy Edwards's luck for the rest of his days!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's going to be a vacancy at Pinkerton's or I'm mistaken. Leave it\r\nat that, McMurdo. At nine to-morrow we'll be with you. You once get the\r\ndoor shut behind him, and you can leave the rest with us.\"\r\n\nAs McMurdo had said, the house in which he lived was a lonely one and\r\nvery well suited for such a crime as they had planned. It was on the\r\nextreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road. In any\r\nother case the conspirators would have simply called out their man, as\r\nthey had many a time before, and emptied their pistols into his body;\r\nbut in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much he\r\nknew, how he knew it, and what had been passed on to his employers.\r\n\r\nIt was possible that they were already too late and that the work had\r\nbeen done. If that was indeed so, they could at least have their\r\nrevenge upon the man who had done it. But they were hopeful that\r\nnothing of great importance had yet come to the detective's knowledge,\r\nas otherwise, they argued, he would not have troubled to write down and\r\nforward such trivial information as McMurdo claimed to have given him.\r\nHowever, all this they would learn from his own lips. Once in their\r\npower, they would find a way to make him speak. It was not the first\r\ntime that they had handled an unwilling witness.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo went to Hobson's Patch as agreed. The police seemed to take\r\nparticular interest in him that morning, and Captain Marvin--he who had\r\nclaimed the old acquaintance with him at Chicago--actually addressed\r\nhim as he waited at the station. McMurdo turned away and refused to\r\nspeak with him. He was back from his mission in the afternoon, and saw\r\nMcGinty at the Union House.\r\n\r\n\"He is coming,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said McGinty. The giant was in his shirt sleeves, with chains\r\nand seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond twinkling\r\nthrough the fringe of his bristling beard. Drink and politics had made\r\nthe Boss a very rich as well as powerful man. The more terrible,\r\ntherefore, seemed that glimpse of the prison or the gallows which had\r\nrisen before him the night before.\r\n\r\n\"Do you reckon he knows much?\" he asked anxiously.\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shook his head gloomily. \"He's been here some time--six weeks\r\nat the least. I guess he didn't come into these parts to look at the\r\nprospect. If he has been working among us all that time with the\r\nrailroad money at his back, I should expect that he has got results,\r\nand that he has passed them on.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's not a weak man in the lodge,\" cried McGinty. \"True as steel,\r\nevery man of them. And yet, by the Lord! there is that skunk Morris.\r\nWhat about him? If any man gives us away, it would be he. I've a mind\r\nto send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a beating\r\nup and see what they can get from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there would be no harm in that,\" McMurdo answered. \"I won't deny\r\nthat I have a liking for Morris and would be sorry to see him come to\r\nharm. He has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters, and though\r\nhe may not see them the same as you or I, he never seemed the sort that\r\nsqueals. But still it is not for me to stand between him and you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll fix the old devil!\" said McGinty with an oath. \"I've had my eye\r\non him this year past.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know best about that,\" McMurdo answered. \"But whatever you\r\ndo must be to-morrow; for we must lie low until the Pinkerton affair is\r\nsettled up. We can't afford to set the police buzzing, to-day of all\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\n\"True for you,\" said McGinty. \"And we'll learn from Birdy Edwards\r\nhimself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first.\r\nDid he seem to scent a trap?\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo laughed. \"I guess I took him on his weak point,\" he said. \"If\r\nhe could get on a good trail of the Scowrers, he's ready to follow it\r\ninto hell. I took his money,\" McMurdo grinned as he produced a wad of\r\ndollar notes, \"and as much more when he has seen all my papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there are no papers. But I filled him up about constitutions and\r\nbooks of rules and forms of membership. He expects to get right down to\r\nthe end of everything before he leaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, he's right there,\" said McGinty grimly. \"Didn't he ask you why\r\nyou didn't bring him the papers?\"\r\n\r\n\"As if I would carry such things, and me a suspected man, and Captain\r\nMarvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, I heard of that,\" said McGinty. \"I guess the heavy end of this\r\nbusiness is coming on to you. We could put him down an old shaft when\r\nwe've done with him; but however we work it we can't get past the man\r\nliving at Hobson's Patch and you being there to-day.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo shrugged his shoulders. \"If we handle it right, they can never\r\nprove the killing,\" said he. \"No one can see him come to the house\r\nafter dark, and I'll lay to it that no one will see him go. Now see\r\nhere, Councillor, I'll show you my plan and I'll ask you to fit the\r\nothers into it. You will all come in good time. Very well. He comes at\r\nten. He is to tap three times, and me to open the door for him. Then\r\nI'll get behind him and shut it. He's our man then.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all easy and plain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but the next step wants considering. He's a hard proposition.\r\nHe's heavily armed. I've fooled him proper, and yet he is likely to be\r\non his guard. Suppose I show him right into a room with seven men in it\r\nwhere he expected to find me alone. There is going to be shooting, and\r\nsomebody is going to be hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township on\r\ntop of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess you are right.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is how I should work it. You will all be in the big room--same as\r\nyou saw when you had a chat with me. I'll open the door for him, show\r\nhim into the parlour beside the door, and leave him there while I get\r\nthe papers. That will give me the chance of telling you how things are\r\nshaping. Then I will go back to him with some faked papers. As he is\r\nreading them I will jump for him and get my grip on his pistol arm.\r\nYou'll hear me call and in you will rush. The quicker the better; for\r\nhe is as strong a man as I, and I may have more than I can manage. But\r\nI allow that I can hold him till you come.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a good plan,\" said McGinty. \"The lodge will owe you a debt for\r\nthis. I guess when I move out of the chair I can put a name to the man\r\nthat's coming after me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, Councillor, I am little more than a recruit,\" said McMurdo; but\r\nhis face showed what he thought of the great man's compliment.\r\n\r\nWhen he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim\r\nevening in front of him. First he cleaned, oiled, and loaded his Smith\r\n& Wesson revolver. Then he surveyed the room in which the detective was\r\nto be trapped. It was a large apartment, with a long deal table in the\r\ncentre, and the big stove at one side. At each of the other sides were\r\nwindows. There were no shutters on these: only light curtains which\r\ndrew across. McMurdo examined these attentively. No doubt it must have\r\nstruck him that the apartment was very exposed for so secret a meeting.\r\nYet its distance from the road made it of less consequence. Finally he\r\ndiscussed the matter with his fellow lodger. Scanlan, though a Scowrer,\r\nwas an inoffensive little man who was too weak to stand against the\r\nopinion of his comrades, but was secretly horrified by the deeds of\r\nblood at which he had sometimes been forced to assist. McMurdo told him\r\nshortly what was intended.\r\n\r\n\"And if I were you, Mike Scanlan, I would take a night off and keep\r\nclear of it. There will be bloody work here before morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, indeed then, Mac,\" Scanlan answered. \"It's not the will but the\r\nnerve that is wanting in me. When I saw Manager Dunn go down at the\r\ncolliery yonder it was just more than I could stand. I'm not made for\r\nit, same as you or McGinty. If the lodge will think none the worse of\r\nme, I'll just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves for the\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\nThe men came in good time as arranged. They were outwardly respectable\r\ncitizens, well clad and cleanly; but a judge of faces would have read\r\nlittle hope for Birdy Edwards in those hard mouths and remorseless\r\neyes. There was not a man in the room whose hands had not been reddened\r\na dozen times before. They were as hardened to human murder as a\r\nbutcher to sheep.\r\n\r\nForemost, of course, both in appearance and in guilt, was the\r\nformidable Boss. Harraway, the secretary, was a lean, bitter man with a\r\nlong, scraggy neck and nervous, jerky limbs, a man of incorruptible\r\nfidelity where the finances of the order were concerned, and with no\r\nnotion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond. The treasurer, Carter,\r\nwas a middle-aged man, with an impassive, rather sulky expression, and\r\na yellow parchment skin. He was a capable organizer, and the actual\r\ndetails of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting brain. The\r\ntwo Willabys were men of action, tall, lithe young fellows with\r\ndetermined faces, while their companion, Tiger Cormac, a heavy, dark\r\nyouth, was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of his\r\ndisposition. These were the men who assembled that night under the roof\r\nof McMurdo for the killing of the Pinkerton detective.\r\n\r\nTheir host had placed whisky upon the table, and they had hastened to\r\nprime themselves for the work before them. Baldwin and Cormac were\r\nalready half-drunk, and the liquor had brought out all their ferocity.\r\nCormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant--it had been\r\nlighted, for the nights were still cold.\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said he, with an oath.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Baldwin, catching his meaning. \"If he is strapped to that,\r\nwe will have the truth out of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll have the truth out of him, never fear,\" said McMurdo. He had\r\nnerves of steel, this man; for though the whole weight of the affair\r\nwas on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever. The others\r\nmarked it and applauded.\r\n\r\n\"You are the one to handle him,\" said the Boss approvingly. \"Not a\r\nwarning will he get till your hand is on his throat. It's a pity there\r\nare no shutters to your windows.\"\r\n\r\nMcMurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter. \"Sure\r\nno one can spy upon us now. It's close upon the hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe he won't come. Maybe he'll get a sniff of danger,\" said the\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n\"He'll come, never fear,\" McMurdo answered. \"He is as eager to come as\r\nyou can be to see him. Hark to that!\"\r\n\r\nThey all sat like wax figures, some with their glasses arrested halfway\r\nto their lips. Three loud knocks had sounded at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" McMurdo raised his hand in caution. An exulting glance went\r\nround the circle, and hands were laid upon hidden weapons.\r\n\r\n\"Not a sound, for your lives!\" McMurdo whispered, as he went from the\r\nroom, closing the door carefully behind him.\r\n\r\nWith strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of\r\ntheir comrade down the passage. Then they heard him open the outer\r\ndoor. There were a few words as of greeting. Then they were aware of a\r\nstrange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice. An instant later came\r\nthe slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock. Their prey\r\nwas safe within the trap. Tiger Cormac laughed horribly, and Boss\r\nMcGinty clapped his great hand across his mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, you fool!\" he whispered. \"You'll be the undoing of us yet!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a mutter of conversation from the next room. It seemed\r\ninterminable. Then the door opened, and McMurdo appeared, his finger\r\nupon his lip.\r\n\r\nHe came to the end of the table and looked round at them. A subtle\r\nchange had come over him. His manner was as of one who has great work\r\nto do. His face had set into granite firmness. His eyes shone with a\r\nfierce excitement behind his spectacles. He had become a visible leader\r\nof men. They stared at him with eager interest; but he said nothing.\r\nStill with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man.\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" cried Boss McGinty at last. \"Is he here? Is Birdy Edwards here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" McMurdo answered slowly. \"Birdy Edwards is here. I am Birdy\r\nEdwards!\"\r\n\r\nThere were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room\r\nmight have been empty, so profound was the silence. The hissing of a\r\nkettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear. Seven white\r\nfaces, all turned upward to this man who dominated them, were set\r\nmotionless with utter terror. Then, with a sudden shivering of glass, a\r\nbristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window, while\r\nthe curtains were torn from their hangings.\r\n\r\nAt the sight Boss McGinty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged\r\nfor the half-opened door. A levelled revolver met him there with the\r\nstern blue eyes of Captain Marvin of the Mine Police gleaming behind\r\nthe sights. The Boss recoiled and fell back into his chair.\r\n\r\n\"You're safer there, Councillor,\" said the man whom they had known as\r\nMcMurdo. \"And you, Baldwin, if you don't take your hand off your\r\npistol, you'll cheat the hangman yet. Pull it out, or by the Lord that\r\nmade me--There, that will do. There are forty armed men round this\r\nhouse, and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you have.\r\nTake their pistols, Marvin!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles. The\r\nmen were disarmed. Sulky, sheepish, and amazed, they still sat round\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to say a word to you before we separate,\" said the man who\r\nhad trapped them. \"I guess we may not meet again until you see me on\r\nthe stand in the courthouse. I'll give you something to think over\r\nbetween now and then. You know me now for what I am. At last I can put\r\nmy cards on the table. I am Birdy Edwards of Pinkerton's. I was chosen\r\nto break up your gang. I had a hard and dangerous game to play. Not a\r\nsoul, not one soul, not my nearest and dearest, knew that I was playing\r\nit. Only Captain Marvin here and my employers knew that. But it's over\r\nto-night, thank God, and I am the winner!\"\r\n\r\nThe seven pale, rigid faces looked up at him. There was unappeasable\r\nhatred in their eyes. He read the relentless threat.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you think that the game is not over yet. Well, I take my chance\r\nof that. Anyhow, some of you will take no further hand, and there are\r\nsixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this night. I'll\r\ntell you this, that when I was put upon this job I never believed there\r\nwas such a society as yours. I thought it was paper talk, and that I\r\nwould prove it so. They told me it was to do with the Freemen; so I\r\nwent to Chicago and was made one. Then I was surer than ever that it\r\nwas just paper talk; for I found no harm in the society, but a deal of\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"Still, I had to carry out my job, and I came to the coal valleys. When\r\nI reached this place I learned that I was wrong and that it wasn't a\r\ndime novel after all. So I stayed to look after it. I never killed a\r\nman in Chicago. I never minted a dollar in my life. Those I gave you\r\nwere as good as any others; but I never spent money better. But I knew\r\nthe way into your good wishes and so I pretended to you that the law\r\nwas after me. It all worked just as I thought.\r\n\r\n\"So I joined your infernal lodge, and I took my share in your councils.\r\nMaybe they will say that I was as bad as you. They can say what they\r\nlike, so long as I get you. But what is the truth? The night I joined\r\nyou beat up old man Stanger. I could not warn him, for there was no\r\ntime; but I held your hand, Baldwin, when you would have killed him. If\r\never I have suggested things, so as to keep my place among you, they\r\nwere things which I knew I could prevent. I could not save Dunn and\r\nMenzies, for I did not know enough; but I will see that their murderers\r\nare hanged. I gave Chester Wilcox warning, so that when I blew his\r\nhouse in he and his folk were in hiding. There was many a crime that I\r\ncould not stop; but if you look back and think how often your man came\r\nhome the other road, or was down in town when you went for him, or\r\nstayed indoors when you thought he would come out, you'll see my work.\"\r\n\r\n\"You blasted traitor!\" hissed McGinty through his closed teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, John McGinty, you may call me that if it eases your smart. You and\r\nyour like have been the enemy of God and man in these parts. It took a\r\nman to get between you and the poor devils of men and women that you\r\nheld under your grip. There was just one way of doing it, and I did it.\r\nYou call me a traitor; but I guess there's many a thousand will call me\r\na deliverer that went down into hell to save them. I've had three\r\nmonths of it. I wouldn't have three such months again if they let me\r\nloose in the treasury at Washington for it. I had to stay till I had it\r\nall, every man and every secret right here in this hand. I'd have\r\nwaited a little longer if it hadn't come to my knowledge that my secret\r\nwas coming out. A letter had come into the town that would have set you\r\nwise to it all. Then I had to act and act quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing more to say to you, except that when my time comes I'll\r\ndie the easier when I think of the work I have done in this valley.\r\nNow, Marvin, I'll keep you no more. Take them in and get it over.\"\r\n\r\nThere is little more to tell. Scanlan had been given a sealed note to\r\nbe left at the address of Miss Ettie Shafter, a mission which he had\r\naccepted with a wink and a knowing smile. In the early hours of the\r\nmorning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special\r\ntrain which had been sent by the railroad company, and made a swift,\r\nunbroken journey out of the land of danger. It was the last time that\r\never either Ettie or her lover set foot in the Valley of Fear. Ten days\r\nlater they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as witness\r\nof the wedding.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the Scowrers was held far from the place where their\r\nadherents might have terrified the guardians of the law. In vain they\r\nstruggled. In vain the money of the lodge--money squeezed by blackmail\r\nout of the whole countryside--was spent like water in the attempt to\r\nsave them. That cold, clear, unimpassioned statement from one who knew\r\nevery detail of their lives, their organization, and their crimes was\r\nunshaken by all the wiles of their defenders. At last after so many\r\nyears they were broken and scattered. The cloud was lifted forever from\r\nthe valley.\r\n\r\nMcGinty met his fate upon the scaffold, cringing and whining when the\r\nlast hour came. Eight of his chief followers shared his fate. Fifty-odd\r\nhad various degrees of imprisonment. The work of Birdy Edwards was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as he had guessed, the game was not over yet. There was\r\nanother hand to be played, and yet another and another. Ted Baldwin,\r\nfor one, had escaped the scaffold; so had the Willabys; so had several\r\nothers of the fiercest spirits of the gang. For ten years they were out\r\nof the world, and then came a day when they were free once more--a day\r\nwhich Edwards, who knew his men, was very sure would be an end of his\r\nlife of peace. They had sworn an oath on all that they thought holy to\r\nhave his blood as a vengeance for their comrades. And well they strove\r\nto keep their vow!\r\n\r\nFrom Chicago he was chased, after two attempts so near success that it\r\nwas sure that the third would get him. From Chicago he went under a\r\nchanged name to California, and it was there that the light went for a\r\ntime out of his life when Ettie Edwards died. Once again he was nearly\r\nkilled, and once again under the name of Douglas he worked in a lonely\r\ncanyon, where with an English partner named Barker he amassed a\r\nfortune. At last there came a warning to him that the bloodhounds were\r\non his track once more, and he cleared--only just in time--for England.\r\nAnd thence came the John Douglas who for a second time married a worthy\r\nmate, and lived for five years as a Sussex county gentleman, a life\r\nwhich ended with the strange happenings of which we have heard.\r\n\nThe police trial had passed, in which the case of John Douglas was\r\nreferred to a higher court. So had the Quarter Sessions, at which he\r\nwas acquitted as having acted in self-defense.\r\n\r\n\"Get him out of England at any cost,\" wrote Holmes to the wife. \"There\r\nare forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has escaped.\r\nThere is no safety for your husband in England.\"\r\n\r\nTwo months had gone by, and the case had to some extent passed from our\r\nminds. Then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into our\r\nletter box. \"Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!\" said this singular epistle.\r\nThere was neither superscription nor signature. I laughed at the quaint\r\nmessage; but Holmes showed unwonted seriousness.\r\n\r\n\"Deviltry, Watson!\" he remarked, and sat long with a clouded brow.\r\n\r\nLate last night Mrs. Hudson, our landlady, brought up a message that a\r\ngentleman wished to see Holmes, and that the matter was of the utmost\r\nimportance. Close at the heels of his messenger came Cecil Barker, our\r\nfriend of the moated Manor House. His face was drawn and haggard.\r\n\r\n\"I've had bad news--terrible news, Mr. Holmes,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I feared as much,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"You have not had a cable, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had a note from someone who has.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's poor Douglas. They tell me his name is Edwards; but he will\r\nalways be Jack Douglas of Benito Canyon to me. I told you that they\r\nstarted together for South Africa in the Palmyra three weeks ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ship reached Cape Town last night. I received this cable from Mrs\r\nDouglas this morning:--\r\n\r\n\"Jack has been lost overboard in gale off St Helena. No one knows how\r\naccident occurred.--Ivy Douglas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! It came like that, did it?\" said Holmes, thoughtfully. \"Well, I've\r\nno doubt it was well stage-managed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that you think there was no accident?\"\r\n\r\n\"None in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely!\"\r\n\r\n\"So I think also. These infernal Scowrers, this cursed vindictive nest\r\nof criminals--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my good sir,\" said Holmes. \"There is a master hand here. It is\r\nno case of sawed-off shot-guns and clumsy six-shooters. You can tell an\r\nold master by the sweep of his brush. I can tell a Moriarty when I see\r\none. This crime is from London, not from America.\"\r\n\r\n\"But for what motive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail--one whose whole\r\nunique position depends upon the fact that all he does must succeed. A\r\ngreat brain and a huge organization have been turned to the extinction\r\nof one man. It is crushing the nut with the hammer--an absurd\r\nextravagance of energy--but the nut is very effectually crushed all the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\n\"How came this man to have anything to do with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the\r\nbusiness was from one of his lieutenants. These Americans were well\r\nadvised. Having an English job to do, they took into partnership, as\r\nany foreign criminal could do, this great consultant in crime. From\r\nthat moment their man was doomed. At first he would content himself by\r\nusing his machinery in order to find their victim. Then he would\r\nindicate how the matter might be treated. Finally, when he read in the\r\nreports of the failure of this agent, he would step in himself with a\r\nmaster touch. You heard me warn this man at Birlstone Manor House that\r\nthe coming danger was greater than the past. Was I right?\"\r\n\r\nBarker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger.\r\n\r\n\"Do you tell me that we have to sit down under this? Do you say that no\r\none can ever get level with this king-devil?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't say that,\" said Holmes, and his eyes seemed to be looking\r\nfar into the future. \"I don't say that he can't be beat. But you must\r\ngive me time--you must give me time!\"\r\n\r\nWe all sat in silence for some minutes, while those fateful eyes still\r\nstrained to pierce the veil.\r\n", "A Study in Scarlet": "IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the\r\nUniversity of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course\r\nprescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my studies there,\r\nI was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant\r\nSurgeon. The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before\r\nI could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out. On landing at\r\nBombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and\r\nwas already deep in the enemy's country. I followed, however, with many\r\nother officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded\r\nin reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once\r\nentered upon my new duties.\r\n\r\nThe campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had\r\nnothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade and\r\nattached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of\r\nMaiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which\r\nshattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I should have\r\nfallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the\r\ndevotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a\r\npack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.\r\n\r\nWorn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had\r\nundergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to\r\nthe base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already improved\r\nso far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little\r\nupon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse\r\nof our Indian possessions. For months my life was despaired of, and\r\nwhen at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and\r\nemaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost\r\nin sending me back to England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the\r\ntroopship \"Orontes,\" and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with\r\nmy health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal\r\ngovernment to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.\r\n\r\nI had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as\r\nair--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will\r\npermit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to\r\nLondon, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of\r\nthe Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for some time at\r\na private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless\r\nexistence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely\r\nthan I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances become, that\r\nI soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate\r\nsomewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in\r\nmy style of living. Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making\r\nup my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less\r\npretentious and less expensive domicile.\r\n\r\nOn the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at\r\nthe Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning\r\nround I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at\r\nBarts. The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is\r\na pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In old days Stamford had never\r\nbeen a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him with enthusiasm,\r\nand he, in his turn, appeared to be delighted to see me. In the\r\nexuberance of my joy, I asked him to lunch with me at the Holborn, and\r\nwe started off together in a hansom.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?\" he asked in\r\nundisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.\r\n\"You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.\"\r\n\r\nI gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it\r\nby the time that we reached our destination.\r\n\r\n\"Poor devil!\" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my\r\nmisfortunes. \"What are you up to now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Looking for lodgings.\" [3] I answered. \"Trying to solve the problem\r\nas to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable\r\nprice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a strange thing,\" remarked my companion; \"you are the second man\r\nto-day that has used that expression to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who was the first?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.\r\nHe was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not get someone\r\nto go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had found, and which\r\nwere too much for his purse.\"\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" I cried, \"if he really wants someone to share the rooms and\r\nthe expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a partner\r\nto being alone.\"\r\n\r\nYoung Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. \"You\r\ndon't know Sherlock Holmes yet,\" he said; \"perhaps you would not care\r\nfor him as a constant companion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what is there against him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little queer\r\nin his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far as I\r\nknow he is a decent fellow enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"A medical student, I suppose?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is well\r\nup in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know,\r\nhe has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His studies are\r\nvery desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of out-of-the way\r\nknowledge which would astonish his professors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you never ask him what he was going in for?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be\r\ncommunicative enough when the fancy seizes him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to meet him,\" I said. \"If I am to lodge with anyone, I\r\nshould prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong\r\nenough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in\r\nAfghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How\r\ncould I meet this friend of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is sure to be at the laboratory,\" returned my companion. \"He either\r\navoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from morning to\r\nnight. If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\nAs we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford\r\ngave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to\r\ntake as a fellow-lodger.\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him,\" he said; \"I know\r\nnothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally in\r\nthe laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me\r\nresponsible.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,\" I answered. \"It\r\nseems to me, Stamford,\" I added, looking hard at my companion, \"that you\r\nhave some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this fellow's\r\ntemper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not easy to express the inexpressible,\" he answered with a laugh.\r\n\"Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to\r\ncold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a little pinch of\r\nthe latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand,\r\nbut simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea\r\nof the effects. To do him justice, I think that he would take it himself\r\nwith the same readiness. He appears to have a passion for definite and\r\nexact knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very right too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the\r\nsubjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking\r\nrather a bizarre shape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beating the subjects!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him\r\nat it with my own eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet you say he is not a medical student?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we\r\nare, and you must form your own impressions about him.\" As he spoke, we\r\nturned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which\r\nopened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar ground to me,\r\nand I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and\r\nmade our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed\r\nwall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low arched passage\r\nbranched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.\r\n\r\nThis was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.\r\nBroad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,\r\ntest-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.\r\nThere was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant\r\ntable absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he glanced round\r\nand sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. \"I've found it! I've\r\nfound it,\" he shouted to my companion, running towards us with a\r\ntest-tube in his hand. \"I have found a re-agent which is precipitated\r\nby hoemoglobin, [4] and by nothing else.\" Had he discovered a gold mine,\r\ngreater delight could not have shone upon his features.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" said Stamford, introducing us.\r\n\r\n\"How are you?\" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength\r\nfor which I should hardly have given him credit. \"You have been in\r\nAfghanistan, I perceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth did you know that?\" I asked in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said he, chuckling to himself. \"The question now is about\r\nhoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of\r\nmine?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,\" I answered, \"but\r\npractically----\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.\r\nDon't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come\r\nover here now!\" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his eagerness, and\r\ndrew me over to the table at which he had been working. \"Let us have\r\nsome fresh blood,\" he said, digging a long bodkin into his finger, and\r\ndrawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette. \"Now, I\r\nadd this small quantity of blood to a litre of water. You perceive that\r\nthe resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion\r\nof blood cannot be more than one in a million. I have no doubt, however,\r\nthat we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction.\" As he\r\nspoke, he threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added\r\nsome drops of a transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a\r\ndull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom\r\nof the glass jar.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a\r\nchild with a new toy. \"What do you think of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to be a very delicate test,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and\r\nuncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The\r\nlatter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this appears\r\nto act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test been\r\ninvented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long\r\nago have paid the penalty of their crimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" I murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is\r\nsuspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His\r\nlinen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.\r\nAre they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains,\r\nor what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert,\r\nand why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock\r\nHolmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his\r\nheart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\"You are to be congratulated,\" I remarked, considerably surprised at his\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would\r\ncertainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was\r\nMason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier,\r\nand Samson of New Orleans. I could name a score of cases in which it\r\nwould have been decisive.\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,\" said Stamford with a\r\nlaugh. \"You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police News\r\nof the Past.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Very interesting reading it might be made, too,\" remarked Sherlock\r\nHolmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his finger.\r\n\"I have to be careful,\" he continued, turning to me with a smile, \"for I\r\ndabble with poisons a good deal.\" He held out his hand as he spoke, and\r\nI noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster,\r\nand discoloured with strong acids.\r\n\r\n\"We came here on business,\" said Stamford, sitting down on a high\r\nthree-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with\r\nhis foot. \"My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were\r\ncomplaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought\r\nthat I had better bring you together.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms with\r\nme. \"I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,\" he said, \"which would\r\nsuit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco,\r\nI hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"I always smoke 'ship's' myself,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally\r\ndo experiments. Would that annoy you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at\r\ntimes, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am\r\nsulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What\r\nhave you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the\r\nworst of one another before they begin to live together.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at this cross-examination. \"I keep a bull pup,\" I said, \"and\r\nI object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts\r\nof ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another set of vices\r\nwhen I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?\" he asked,\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"It depends on the player,\" I answered. \"A well-played violin is a treat\r\nfor the gods--a badly-played one----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" he cried, with a merry laugh. \"I think we may\r\nconsider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"When shall we see them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle\r\neverything,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"All right--noon exactly,\" said I, shaking his hand.\r\n\r\nWe left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together towards\r\nmy hotel.\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, \"how\r\nthe deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?\"\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled an enigmatical smile. \"That's just his little\r\npeculiarity,\" he said. \"A good many people have wanted to know how he\r\nfinds things out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! a mystery is it?\" I cried, rubbing my hands. \"This is very piquant.\r\nI am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The proper study of\r\nmankind is man,' you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must study him, then,\" Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.\r\n\"You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more\r\nabout you than you about him. Good-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably\r\ninterested in my new acquaintance.\r\n\nWE met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,\r\n[5] Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They\r\nconsisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large\r\nairy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad\r\nwindows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate\r\ndid the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was\r\nconcluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.\r\nThat very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the\r\nfollowing morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and\r\nportmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and\r\nlaying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we\r\ngradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nHolmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet\r\nin his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be\r\nup after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out\r\nbefore I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the chemical\r\nlaboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long\r\nwalks, which appeared to take him into the lowest portions of the City.\r\nNothing could exceed his energy when the working fit was upon him; but\r\nnow and again a reaction would seize him, and for days on end he would\r\nlie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving\r\na muscle from morning to night. On these occasions I have noticed such\r\na dreamy, vacant expression in his eyes, that I might have suspected him\r\nof being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance\r\nand cleanliness of his whole life forbidden such a notion.\r\n\r\nAs the weeks went by, my interest in him and my curiosity as to his\r\naims in life, gradually deepened and increased. His very person and\r\nappearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual\r\nobserver. In height he was rather over six feet, and so excessively\r\nlean that he seemed to be considerably taller. His eyes were sharp and\r\npiercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded;\r\nand his thin, hawk-like nose gave his whole expression an air of\r\nalertness and decision. His chin, too, had the prominence and squareness\r\nwhich mark the man of determination. His hands were invariably\r\nblotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he was possessed of\r\nextraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe\r\nwhen I watched him manipulating his fragile philosophical instruments.\r\n\r\nThe reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how\r\nmuch this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured\r\nto break through the reticence which he showed on all that concerned\r\nhimself. Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how\r\nobjectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.\r\nMy health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was\r\nexceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and\r\nbreak the monotony of my daily existence. Under these circumstances, I\r\neagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and\r\nspent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.\r\n\r\nHe was not studying medicine. He had himself, in reply to a question,\r\nconfirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Neither did he appear to\r\nhave pursued any course of reading which might fit him for a degree in\r\nscience or any other recognized portal which would give him an entrance\r\ninto the learned world. Yet his zeal for certain studies was remarkable,\r\nand within eccentric limits his knowledge was so extraordinarily ample\r\nand minute that his observations have fairly astounded me. Surely no man\r\nwould work so hard or attain such precise information unless he had some\r\ndefinite end in view. Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the\r\nexactness of their learning. No man burdens his mind with small matters\r\nunless he has some very good reason for doing so.\r\n\r\nHis ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary\r\nliterature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing.\r\nUpon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he inquired in the naivest way who he\r\nmight be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however,\r\nwhen I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory\r\nand of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human\r\nbeing in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth\r\ntravelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact\r\nthat I could hardly realize it.\r\n\r\n\"You appear to be astonished,\" he said, smiling at my expression of\r\nsurprise. \"Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"To forget it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he explained, \"I consider that a man's brain originally is\r\nlike a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture\r\nas you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he\r\ncomes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets\r\ncrowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that\r\nhe has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman\r\nis very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will\r\nhave nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of\r\nthese he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It\r\nis a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can\r\ndistend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every\r\naddition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is\r\nof the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing\r\nout the useful ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Solar System!\" I protested.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce is it to me?\" he interrupted impatiently; \"you say\r\nthat we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a\r\npennyworth of difference to me or to my work.\"\r\n\r\nI was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but something\r\nin his manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one. I\r\npondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw\r\nmy deductions from it. He said that he would acquire no knowledge which\r\ndid not bear upon his object. Therefore all the knowledge which he\r\npossessed was such as would be useful to him. I enumerated in my own\r\nmind all the various points upon which he had shown me that he was\r\nexceptionally well-informed. I even took a pencil and jotted them down.\r\nI could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran\r\nin this way--\r\n\r\n\r\nSHERLOCK HOLMES--his limits.\r\n\r\n  1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil.\r\n  2.              Philosophy.--Nil.\r\n  3.              Astronomy.--Nil.\r\n  4.              Politics.--Feeble.\r\n  5.              Botany.--Variable.  Well up in belladonna,\r\n                              opium, and poisons generally.\r\n                              Knows nothing of practical gardening.\r\n  6.              Geology.--Practical, but limited.\r\n                               Tells at a glance different soils\r\n                               from each other.  After walks has\r\n                               shown me splashes upon his trousers,\r\n                               and told me by their colour and\r\n                               consistence in what part of London\r\n                               he had received them.\r\n  7.              Chemistry.--Profound.\r\n  8.              Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic.\r\n  9.              Sensational Literature.--Immense.  He appears\r\n                              to know every detail of every horror\r\n                              perpetrated in the century.\r\n  10. Plays the violin well.\r\n  11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.\r\n  12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.\r\n\"If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all\r\nthese accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,\"\r\nI said to myself, \"I may as well give up the attempt at once.\"\r\n\r\nI see that I have alluded above to his powers upon the violin. These\r\nwere very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his other accomplishments.\r\nThat he could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because\r\nat my request he has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other\r\nfavourites. When left to himself, however, he would seldom produce any\r\nmusic or attempt any recognized air. Leaning back in his arm-chair of\r\nan evening, he would close his eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle\r\nwhich was thrown across his knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and\r\nmelancholy. Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they\r\nreflected the thoughts which possessed him, but whether the music aided\r\nthose thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim\r\nor fancy was more than I could determine. I might have rebelled against\r\nthese exasperating solos had it not been that he usually terminated them\r\nby playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a\r\nslight compensation for the trial upon my patience.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think\r\nthat my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself. Presently,\r\nhowever, I found that he had many acquaintances, and those in the most\r\ndifferent classes of society. There was one little sallow rat-faced,\r\ndark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came\r\nthree or four times in a single week. One morning a young girl called,\r\nfashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. The same\r\nafternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew\r\npedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely\r\nfollowed by a slip-shod elderly woman. On another occasion an old\r\nwhite-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on\r\nanother a railway porter in his velveteen uniform. When any of these\r\nnondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to\r\nbeg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.\r\nHe always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience. \"I have\r\nto use this room as a place of business,\" he said, \"and these people\r\nare my clients.\" Again I had an opportunity of asking him a point blank\r\nquestion, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to\r\nconfide in me. I imagined at the time that he had some strong reason for\r\nnot alluding to it, but he soon dispelled the idea by coming round to\r\nthe subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I\r\nrose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not\r\nyet finished his breakfast. The landlady had become so accustomed to my\r\nlate habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With\r\nthe unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt\r\nintimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table\r\nand attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched\r\nsilently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the\r\nheading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.\r\n\r\nIts somewhat ambitious title was \"The Book of Life,\" and it attempted to\r\nshow how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic\r\nexamination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a\r\nremarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was\r\nclose and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched\r\nand exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch\r\nof a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts.\r\nDeceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one\r\ntrained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible\r\nas so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear\r\nto the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had\r\narrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.\r\n\r\n\"From a drop of water,\" said the writer, \"a logician could infer the\r\npossibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of\r\none or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is\r\nknown whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts,\r\nthe Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired\r\nby long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal\r\nto attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to\r\nthose moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest\r\ndifficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary\r\nproblems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to\r\ndistinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to\r\nwhich he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the\r\nfaculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look\r\nfor. By a man's finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his\r\ntrouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his\r\nexpression, by his shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling\r\nis plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the\r\ncompetent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ineffable twaddle!\" I cried, slapping the magazine down on the\r\ntable, \"I never read such rubbish in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Why, this article,\" I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat\r\ndown to my breakfast. \"I see that you have read it since you have marked\r\nit. I don't deny that it is smartly written. It irritates me though. It\r\nis evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these\r\nneat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his own study. It is not\r\npractical. I should like to see him clapped down in a third class\r\ncarriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his\r\nfellow-travellers. I would lay a thousand to one against him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would lose your money,\" Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly. \"As for\r\nthe article I wrote it myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction. The\r\ntheories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so\r\nchimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend\r\nupon them for my bread and cheese.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how?\" I asked involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the\r\nworld. I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is.\r\nHere in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private\r\nones. When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to\r\nput them on the right scent. They lay all the evidence before me, and I\r\nam generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of\r\ncrime, to set them straight. There is a strong family resemblance about\r\nmisdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger\r\nends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first. Lestrade\r\nis a well-known detective. He got himself into a fog recently over a\r\nforgery case, and that was what brought him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And these other people?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are\r\nall people who are in trouble about something, and want a little\r\nenlightening. I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and\r\nthen I pocket my fee.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you mean to say,\" I said, \"that without leaving your room you\r\ncan unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they\r\nhave seen every detail for themselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case\r\nturns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and\r\nsee things with my own eyes. You see I have a lot of special knowledge\r\nwhich I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully.\r\nThose rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your\r\nscorn, are invaluable to me in practical work. Observation with me is\r\nsecond nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our\r\nfirst meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were told, no doubt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the sort. I _knew_ you came from Afghanistan. From long\r\nhabit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I\r\narrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.\r\nThere were such steps, however. The train of reasoning ran, 'Here is a\r\ngentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man. Clearly\r\nan army doctor, then. He has just come from the tropics, for his face is\r\ndark, and that is not the natural tint of his skin, for his wrists are\r\nfair. He has undergone hardship and sickness, as his haggard face says\r\nclearly. His left arm has been injured. He holds it in a stiff and\r\nunnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have\r\nseen much hardship and got his arm wounded? Clearly in Afghanistan.' The\r\nwhole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you\r\ncame from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is simple enough as you explain it,\" I said, smiling. \"You remind\r\nme of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did\r\nexist outside of stories.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes rose and lit his pipe. \"No doubt you think that you are\r\ncomplimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,\" he observed. \"Now, in my\r\nopinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. That trick of his of breaking\r\nin on his friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of\r\nan hour's silence is really very showy and superficial. He had some\r\nanalytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as\r\nPoe appeared to imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you read Gaboriau's works?\" I asked. \"Does Lecoq come up to your\r\nidea of a detective?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. \"Lecoq was a miserable bungler,\"\r\nhe said, in an angry voice; \"he had only one thing to recommend him, and\r\nthat was his energy. That book made me positively ill. The question was\r\nhow to identify an unknown prisoner. I could have done it in twenty-four\r\nhours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for\r\ndetectives to teach them what to avoid.\"\r\n\r\nI felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired\r\ntreated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood\r\nlooking out into the busy street. \"This fellow may be very clever,\" I\r\nsaid to myself, \"but he is certainly very conceited.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,\" he said,\r\nquerulously. \"What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know\r\nwell that I have it in me to make my name famous. No man lives or has\r\never lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural\r\ntalent to the detection of crime which I have done. And what is the\r\nresult? There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy\r\nwith a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see\r\nthrough it.\"\r\n\r\nI was still annoyed at his bumptious style of conversation. I thought it\r\nbest to change the topic.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what that fellow is looking for?\" I asked, pointing to a\r\nstalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the\r\nother side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers. He had\r\na large blue envelope in his hand, and was evidently the bearer of a\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\"You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Brag and bounce!\" thought I to myself. \"He knows that I cannot verify\r\nhis guess.\"\r\n\r\nThe thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were\r\nwatching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across\r\nthe roadway. We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps\r\nascending the stair.\r\n\r\n\"For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\" he said, stepping into the room and handing\r\nmy friend the letter.\r\n\r\nHere was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him. He little\r\nthought of this when he made that random shot. \"May I ask, my lad,\" I\r\nsaid, in the blandest voice, \"what your trade may be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Commissionaire, sir,\" he said, gruffly. \"Uniform away for repairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you were?\" I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\nHe clicked his heels together, raised his hand in a salute, and was\r\ngone.\r\n\nI CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the\r\npractical nature of my companion's theories. My respect for his powers\r\nof analysis increased wondrously. There still remained some lurking\r\nsuspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged\r\nepisode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he could have\r\nin taking me in was past my comprehension. When I looked at him he\r\nhad finished reading the note, and his eyes had assumed the vacant,\r\nlack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.\r\n\r\n\"How in the world did you deduce that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Deduce what?\" said he, petulantly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that he was a retired sergeant of Marines.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no time for trifles,\" he answered, brusquely; then with a smile,\r\n\"Excuse my rudeness. You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps\r\nit is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a\r\nsergeant of Marines?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. If you\r\nwere asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some\r\ndifficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact. Even across the\r\nstreet I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the\r\nfellow's hand. That smacked of the sea. He had a military carriage,\r\nhowever, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He was\r\na man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.\r\nYou must have observed the way in which he held his head and swung\r\nhis cane. A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of\r\nhim--all facts which led me to believe that he had been a sergeant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"Commonplace,\" said Holmes, though I thought from his expression that he\r\nwas pleased at my evident surprise and admiration. \"I said just now that\r\nthere were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!\" He\r\nthrew me over the note which the commissionaire had brought. [7]\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" I cried, as I cast my eye over it, \"this is terrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"It does seem to be a little out of the common,\" he remarked, calmly.\r\n\"Would you mind reading it to me aloud?\"\r\n\r\nThis is the letter which I read to him----\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--\r\n\r\n\"There has been a bad business during the night at 3, Lauriston Gardens,\r\noff the Brixton Road. Our man on the beat saw a light there about two in\r\nthe morning, and as the house was an empty one, suspected that something\r\nwas amiss. He found the door open, and in the front room, which is bare\r\nof furniture, discovered the body of a gentleman, well dressed, and\r\nhaving cards in his pocket bearing the name of 'Enoch J. Drebber,\r\nCleveland, Ohio, U.S.A.' There had been no robbery, nor is there any\r\nevidence as to how the man met his death. There are marks of blood in\r\nthe room, but there is no wound upon his person. We are at a loss as to\r\nhow he came into the empty house; indeed, the whole affair is a puzzler.\r\nIf you can come round to the house any time before twelve, you will find\r\nme there. I have left everything _in statu quo_ until I hear from you.\r\nIf you are unable to come I shall give you fuller details, and would\r\nesteem it a great kindness if you would favour me with your opinion.\r\nYours faithfully,\r\n\r\n\"TOBIAS GREGSON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Gregson is the smartest of the Scotland Yarders,\" my friend remarked;\r\n\"he and Lestrade are the pick of a bad lot. They are both quick and\r\nenergetic, but conventional--shockingly so. They have their knives\r\ninto one another, too. They are as jealous as a pair of professional\r\nbeauties. There will be some fun over this case if they are both put\r\nupon the scent.\"\r\n\r\nI was amazed at the calm way in which he rippled on. \"Surely there is\r\nnot a moment to be lost,\" I cried, \"shall I go and order you a cab?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure about whether I shall go. I am the most incurably lazy\r\ndevil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me,\r\nfor I can be spry enough at times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is just such a chance as you have been longing for.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, what does it matter to me. Supposing I unravel the\r\nwhole matter, you may be sure that Gregson, Lestrade, and Co. will\r\npocket all the credit. That comes of being an unofficial personage.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he begs you to help him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but\r\nhe would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.\r\nHowever, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my\r\nown hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!\"\r\n\r\nHe hustled on his overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that\r\nan energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.\r\n\r\n\"Get your hat,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You wish me to come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if you have nothing better to do.\" A minute later we were both in\r\na hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road.\r\n\r\nIt was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the\r\nhouse-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets\r\nbeneath. My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away\r\nabout Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and\r\nan Amati. As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the\r\nmelancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.\r\n\r\n\"You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,\" I said at\r\nlast, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.\r\n\r\n\"No data yet,\" he answered. \"It is a capital mistake to theorize before\r\nyou have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will have your data soon,\" I remarked, pointing with my finger;\r\n\"this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much\r\nmistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is. Stop, driver, stop!\" We were still a hundred yards or so from\r\nit, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nNumber 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was\r\none of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being\r\noccupied and two empty. The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant\r\nmelancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and\r\nthere a \"To Let\" card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared\r\npanes. A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly\r\nplants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed\r\nby a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a\r\nmixture of clay and of gravel. The whole place was very sloppy from the\r\nrain which had fallen through the night. The garden was bounded by a\r\nthree-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and\r\nagainst this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by\r\na small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes\r\nin the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.\r\n\r\nI had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the\r\nhouse and plunged into a study of the mystery. Nothing appeared to be\r\nfurther from his intention. With an air of nonchalance which, under the\r\ncircumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he lounged up\r\nand down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the\r\nopposite houses and the line of railings. Having finished his scrutiny,\r\nhe proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass\r\nwhich flanked the path, keeping his eyes riveted upon the ground. Twice\r\nhe stopped, and once I saw him smile, and heard him utter an exclamation\r\nof satisfaction. There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey\r\nsoil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was\r\nunable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.\r\nStill I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his\r\nperceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he could see a great deal\r\nwhich was hidden from me.\r\n\r\nAt the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced,\r\nflaxen-haired man, with a notebook in his hand, who rushed forward and\r\nwrung my companion's hand with effusion. \"It is indeed kind of you to\r\ncome,\" he said, \"I have had everything left untouched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Except that!\" my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. \"If a herd\r\nof buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess. No\r\ndoubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you\r\npermitted this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had so much to do inside the house,\" the detective said\r\nevasively. \"My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him\r\nto look after this.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. \"With two\r\nsuch men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be\r\nmuch for a third party to find out,\" he said.\r\n\r\nGregson rubbed his hands in a self-satisfied way. \"I think we have done\r\nall that can be done,\" he answered; \"it's a queer case though, and I\r\nknew your taste for such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not come here in a cab?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor Lestrade?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us go and look at the room.\" With which inconsequent remark he\r\nstrode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed\r\nhis astonishment.\r\n\r\nA short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices.\r\nTwo doors opened out of it to the left and to the right. One of these\r\nhad obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the\r\ndining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had\r\noccurred. Holmes walked in, and I followed him with that subdued feeling\r\nat my heart which the presence of death inspires.\r\n\r\nIt was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence\r\nof all furniture. A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was\r\nblotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had\r\nbecome detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.\r\nOpposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of\r\nimitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a\r\nred wax candle. The solitary window was so dirty that the light was\r\nhazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was\r\nintensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.\r\n\r\nAll these details I observed afterwards. At present my attention was\r\ncentred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon\r\nthe boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured\r\nceiling. It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of\r\nage, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and\r\na short stubbly beard. He was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat\r\nand waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar\r\nand cuffs. A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor\r\nbeside him. His hands were clenched and his arms thrown abroad, while\r\nhis lower limbs were interlocked as though his death struggle had been a\r\ngrievous one. On his rigid face there stood an expression of horror,\r\nand as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human\r\nfeatures. This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low\r\nforehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly\r\nsimious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his writhing,\r\nunnatural posture. I have seen death in many forms, but never has\r\nit appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy\r\napartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nLestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and\r\ngreeted my companion and myself.\r\n\r\n\"This case will make a stir, sir,\" he remarked. \"It beats anything I\r\nhave seen, and I am no chicken.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no clue?\" said Gregson.\r\n\r\n\"None at all,\" chimed in Lestrade.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it\r\nintently. \"You are sure that there is no wound?\" he asked, pointing to\r\nnumerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.\r\n\r\n\"Positive!\" cried both detectives.\r\n\r\n\"Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual--[8]\r\npresumably the murderer, if murder has been committed. It reminds me of\r\nthe circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in\r\nthe year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It\r\nhas all been done before.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, his nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere,\r\nfeeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his eyes wore the same\r\nfar-away expression which I have already remarked upon. So swiftly was\r\nthe examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness\r\nwith which it was conducted. Finally, he sniffed the dead man's lips,\r\nand then glanced at the soles of his patent leather boots.\r\n\r\n\"He has not been moved at all?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can take him to the mortuary now,\" he said. \"There is nothing more\r\nto be learned.\"\r\n\r\nGregson had a stretcher and four men at hand. At his call they entered\r\nthe room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised\r\nhim, a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor. Lestrade grabbed\r\nit up and stared at it with mystified eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There's been a woman here,\" he cried. \"It's a woman's wedding-ring.\"\r\n\r\nHe held it out, as he spoke, upon the palm of his hand. We all gathered\r\nround him and gazed at it. There could be no doubt that that circlet of\r\nplain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride.\r\n\r\n\"This complicates matters,\" said Gregson. \"Heaven knows, they were\r\ncomplicated enough before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're sure it doesn't simplify them?\" observed Holmes. \"There's\r\nnothing to be learned by staring at it. What did you find in his\r\npockets?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have it all here,\" said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects\r\nupon one of the bottom steps of the stairs. \"A gold watch, No. 97163, by\r\nBarraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid. Gold ring,\r\nwith masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes.\r\nRussian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland,\r\ncorresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen. No purse, but loose\r\nmoney to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of\r\nBoccaccio's 'Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the\r\nfly-leaf. Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph\r\nStangerson.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what address?\"\r\n\r\n\"American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for. They are both\r\nfrom the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their\r\nboats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to\r\nreturn to New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did it at once, sir,\" said Gregson. \"I have had advertisements\r\nsent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American\r\nExchange, but he has not returned yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you sent to Cleveland?\"\r\n\r\n\"We telegraphed this morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you word your inquiries?\"\r\n\r\n\"We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad\r\nof any information which could help us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to\r\nbe crucial?\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked about Stangerson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing else? Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears\r\nto hinge? Will you not telegraph again?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have said all I have to say,\" said Gregson, in an offended voice.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make\r\nsome remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we\r\nwere holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene,\r\nrubbing his hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Gregson,\" he said, \"I have just made a discovery of the highest\r\nimportance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a\r\ncareful examination of the walls.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man's eyes sparkled as he spoke, and he was evidently in\r\na state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his\r\ncolleague.\r\n\r\n\"Come here,\" he said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of\r\nwhich felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate. \"Now, stand\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\nHe struck a match on his boot and held it up against the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that!\" he said, triumphantly.\r\n\r\nI have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this\r\nparticular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a\r\nyellow square of coarse plastering. Across this bare space there was\r\nscrawled in blood-red letters a single word--\r\n\r\n                         RACHE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that?\" cried the detective, with the air of a\r\nshowman exhibiting his show. \"This was overlooked because it was in the\r\ndarkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there. The\r\nmurderer has written it with his or her own blood. See this smear where\r\nit has trickled down the wall! That disposes of the idea of suicide\r\nanyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you. See\r\nthat candle on the mantelpiece. It was lit at the time, and if it was\r\nlit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of\r\nthe wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what does it mean now that you _have_ found it?\" asked Gregson in a\r\ndepreciatory voice.\r\n\r\n\"Mean? Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name\r\nRachel, but was disturbed before he or she had time to finish. You mark\r\nmy words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a\r\nwoman named Rachel has something to do with it. It's all very well for\r\nyou to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but\r\nthe old hound is the best, when all is said and done.\"\r\n\r\n\"I really beg your pardon!\" said my companion, who had ruffled the\r\nlittle man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter. \"You\r\ncertainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out,\r\nand, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other\r\nparticipant in last night's mystery. I have not had time to examine this\r\nroom yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, he whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying\r\nglass from his pocket. With these two implements he trotted noiselessly\r\nabout the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once\r\nlying flat upon his face. So engrossed was he with his occupation that\r\nhe appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he chattered away to\r\nhimself under his breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire\r\nof exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of\r\nencouragement and of hope. As I watched him I was irresistibly reminded\r\nof a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and\r\nforwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes\r\nacross the lost scent. For twenty minutes or more he continued his\r\nresearches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between\r\nmarks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his\r\ntape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner. In one place\r\nhe gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor,\r\nand packed it away in an envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass\r\nthe word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most\r\nminute exactness. This done, he appeared to be satisfied, for he\r\nreplaced his tape and his glass in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,\" he\r\nremarked with a smile. \"It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to\r\ndetective work.\"\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres [9] of their amateur\r\ncompanion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. They evidently\r\nfailed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that\r\nSherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some\r\ndefinite and practical end.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of it, sir?\" they both asked.\r\n\r\n\"It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume\r\nto help you,\" remarked my friend. \"You are doing so well now that it\r\nwould be a pity for anyone to interfere.\" There was a world of\r\nsarcasm in his voice as he spoke. \"If you will let me know how your\r\ninvestigations go,\" he continued, \"I shall be happy to give you any help\r\nI can. In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found\r\nthe body. Can you give me his name and address?\"\r\n\r\nLestrade glanced at his note-book. \"John Rance,\" he said. \"He is off\r\nduty now. You will find him at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes took a note of the address.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, Doctor,\" he said; \"we shall go and look him up. I'll tell\r\nyou one thing which may help you in the case,\" he continued, turning to\r\nthe two detectives. \"There has been murder done, and the murderer was a\r\nman. He was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had\r\nsmall feet for his height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a\r\nTrichinopoly cigar. He came here with his victim in a four-wheeled cab,\r\nwhich was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his\r\noff fore leg. In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the\r\nfinger-nails of his right hand were remarkably long. These are only a\r\nfew indications, but they may assist you.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n\"If this man was murdered, how was it done?\" asked the former.\r\n\r\n\"Poison,\" said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. \"One other thing,\r\nLestrade,\" he added, turning round at the door: \"'Rache,' is the German\r\nfor 'revenge;' so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.\"\r\n\r\nWith which Parthian shot he walked away, leaving the two rivals\r\nopen-mouthed behind him.\r\n\nIT was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock\r\nHolmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a\r\nlong telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us\r\nto the address given us by Lestrade.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing like first hand evidence,\" he remarked; \"as a matter\r\nof fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as\r\nwell learn all that is to be learned.\"\r\n\r\n\"You amaze me, Holmes,\" said I. \"Surely you are not as sure as you\r\npretend to be of all those particulars which you gave.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no room for a mistake,\" he answered. \"The very first thing\r\nwhich I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with\r\nits wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain\r\nfor a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must\r\nhave been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse's\r\nhoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than\r\nthat of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab\r\nwas there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the\r\nmorning--I have Gregson's word for that--it follows that it must have\r\nbeen there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two\r\nindividuals to the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems simple enough,\" said I; \"but how about the other man's\r\nheight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from\r\nthe length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though\r\nthere is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow's stride\r\nboth on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of\r\nchecking my calculation. When a man writes on a wall, his instinct leads\r\nhim to write about the level of his own eyes. Now that writing was just\r\nover six feet from the ground. It was child's play.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his age?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest\r\neffort, he can't be quite in the sere and yellow. That was the breadth\r\nof a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked across.\r\nPatent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over.\r\nThere is no mystery about it at all. I am simply applying to ordinary\r\nlife a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I\r\nadvocated in that article. Is there anything else that puzzles you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in\r\nblood. My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly\r\nscratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's\r\nnail had been trimmed. I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor.\r\nIt was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a\r\nTrichinopoly. I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I\r\nhave written a monograph upon the subject. I flatter myself that I can\r\ndistinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar\r\nor of tobacco. It is just in such details that the skilled detective\r\ndiffers from the Gregson and Lestrade type.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the florid face?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was\r\nright. You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair.\"\r\n\r\nI passed my hand over my brow. \"My head is in a whirl,\" I remarked; \"the\r\nmore one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two\r\nmen--if there were two men--into an empty house? What has become of the\r\ncabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison?\r\nWhere did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer,\r\nsince robbery had no part in it? How came the woman's ring there? Above\r\nall, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before\r\ndecamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling\r\nall these facts.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion smiled approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,\" he\r\nsaid. \"There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up\r\nmy mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade's discovery it was simply\r\na blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting\r\nSocialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if\r\nyou noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real\r\nGerman invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely\r\nsay that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who\r\noverdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong\r\nchannel. I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. You\r\nknow a conjuror gets no credit when once he has explained his trick,\r\nand if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the\r\nconclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never do that,\" I answered; \"you have brought detection as near\r\nan exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.\"\r\n\r\nMy companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way\r\nin which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive\r\nto flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you one other thing,\" he said. \"Patent leathers [10] and\r\nSquare-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway\r\ntogether as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.\r\nWhen they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather,\r\nPatent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down. I\r\ncould read all that in the dust; and I could read that as he walked he\r\ngrew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his\r\nstrides. He was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt,\r\ninto a fury. Then the tragedy occurred. I've told you all I know myself\r\nnow, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working\r\nbasis, however, on which to start. We must hurry up, for I want to go to\r\nHalle's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way\r\nthrough a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In the\r\ndingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.\r\n\"That's Audley Court in there,\" he said, pointing to a narrow slit in\r\nthe line of dead-coloured brick. \"You'll find me here when you come\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nAudley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us\r\ninto a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings. We\r\npicked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of\r\ndiscoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which\r\nwas decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was\r\nengraved. On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were\r\nshown into a little front parlour to await his coming.\r\n\r\nHe appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in\r\nhis slumbers. \"I made my report at the office,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHolmes took a half-sovereign from his pocket and played with it\r\npensively. \"We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own\r\nlips,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,\" the constable\r\nanswered with his eyes upon the little golden disk.\r\n\r\n\"Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred.\"\r\n\r\nRance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his brows as though\r\ndetermined not to omit anything in his narrative.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell it ye from the beginning,\" he said. \"My time is from ten at\r\nnight to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the 'White\r\nHart'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat. At one o'clock it\r\nbegan to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him who has the Holland Grove\r\nbeat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin'.\r\nPresently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take\r\na look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road. It was\r\nprecious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down,\r\nthough a cab or two went past me. I was a strollin' down, thinkin'\r\nbetween ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when\r\nsuddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same\r\nhouse. Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty\r\non account of him that owns them who won't have the drains seen to,\r\nthough the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid\r\nfever. I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in\r\nthe window, and I suspected as something was wrong. When I got to the\r\ndoor----\"\r\n\r\n\"You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,\" my companion\r\ninterrupted. \"What did you do that for?\"\r\n\r\nRance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost\r\namazement upon his features.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's true, sir,\" he said; \"though how you come to know it,\r\nHeaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and\r\nso lonesome, that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one with me.\r\nI ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave; but I thought\r\nthat maybe it was him that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains\r\nwhat killed him. The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I walked back\r\nto the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but there wasn't no\r\nsign of him nor of anyone else.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was no one in the street?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself\r\ntogether and went back and pushed the door open. All was quiet inside,\r\nso I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. There was a\r\ncandle flickerin' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I\r\nsaw----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know all that you saw. You walked round the room several times,\r\nand you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried\r\nthe kitchen door, and then----\"\r\n\r\nJohn Rance sprang to his feet with a frightened face and suspicion in\r\nhis eyes. \"Where was you hid to see all that?\" he cried. \"It seems to me\r\nthat you knows a deal more than you should.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed and threw his card across the table to the constable.\r\n\"Don't get arresting me for the murder,\" he said. \"I am one of the\r\nhounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for\r\nthat. Go on, though. What did you do next?\"\r\n\r\nRance resumed his seat, without however losing his mystified expression.\r\n\"I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle. That brought Murcher\r\nand two more to the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the street empty then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nThe constable's features broadened into a grin. \"I've seen many a drunk\r\nchap in my time,\" he said, \"but never anyone so cryin' drunk as\r\nthat cove. He was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up agin the\r\nrailings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his lungs about Columbine's\r\nNew-fangled Banner, or some such stuff. He couldn't stand, far less\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a man was he?\" asked Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nJohn Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression. \"He was\r\nan uncommon drunk sort o' man,\" he said. \"He'd ha' found hisself in the\r\nstation if we hadn't been so took up.\"\r\n\r\n\"His face--his dress--didn't you notice them?\" Holmes broke in\r\nimpatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him up--me\r\nand Murcher between us. He was a long chap, with a red face, the lower\r\npart muffled round----\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" cried Holmes. \"What became of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd enough to do without lookin' after him,\" the policeman said, in an\r\naggrieved voice. \"I'll wager he found his way home all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was he dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"A brown overcoat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he a whip in his hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"A whip--no.\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have left it behind,\" muttered my companion. \"You didn't happen\r\nto see or hear a cab after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a half-sovereign for you,\" my companion said, standing up and\r\ntaking his hat. \"I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the\r\nforce. That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You\r\nmight have gained your sergeant's stripes last night. The man whom you\r\nheld in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and\r\nwhom we are seeking. There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you\r\nthat it is so. Come along, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\nWe started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous,\r\nbut obviously uncomfortable.\r\n\r\n\"The blundering fool,\" Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our\r\nlodgings. \"Just to think of his having such an incomparable bit of good\r\nluck, and not taking advantage of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am rather in the dark still. It is true that the description of this\r\nman tallies with your idea of the second party in this mystery. But why\r\nshould he come back to the house after leaving it? That is not the way\r\nof criminals.\"\r\n\r\n\"The ring, man, the ring: that was what he came back for. If we have no\r\nother way of catching him, we can always bait our line with the ring. I\r\nshall have him, Doctor--I'll lay you two to one that I have him. I must\r\nthank you for it all. I might not have gone but for you, and so have\r\nmissed the finest study I ever came across: a study in scarlet, eh?\r\nWhy shouldn't we use a little art jargon. There's the scarlet thread of\r\nmurder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is\r\nto unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it. And now\r\nfor lunch, and then for Norman Neruda. Her attack and her bowing\r\nare splendid. What's that little thing of Chopin's she plays so\r\nmagnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay.\"\r\n\r\nLeaning back in the cab, this amateur bloodhound carolled away like a\r\nlark while I meditated upon the many-sidedness of the human mind.\r\n\nOUR morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was\r\ntired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' departure for the concert, I\r\nlay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep.\r\nIt was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much excited by all that\r\nhad occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into\r\nit. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted\r\nbaboon-like countenance of the murdered man. So sinister was the\r\nimpression which that face had produced upon me that I found it\r\ndifficult to feel anything but gratitude for him who had removed its\r\nowner from the world. If ever human features bespoke vice of the most\r\nmalignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of\r\nCleveland. Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the\r\ndepravity of the victim was no condonment [11] in the eyes of the law.\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's\r\nhypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how he\r\nhad sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that he had detected something\r\nwhich had given rise to the idea. Then, again, if not poison, what\r\nhad caused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of\r\nstrangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so\r\nthickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the\r\nvictim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As\r\nlong as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be\r\nno easy matter, either for Holmes or myself. His quiet self-confident\r\nmanner convinced me that he had already formed a theory which explained\r\nall the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.\r\n\r\nHe was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert\r\ncould not have detained him all the time. Dinner was on the table before\r\nhe appeared.\r\n\r\n\"It was magnificent,\" he said, as he took his seat. \"Do you remember\r\nwhat Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and\r\nappreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of\r\nspeech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced\r\nby it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries\r\nwhen the world was in its childhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's rather a broad idea,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret\r\nNature,\" he answered. \"What's the matter? You're not looking quite\r\nyourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth, it has,\" I said. \"I ought to be more case-hardened\r\nafter my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at\r\nMaiwand without losing my nerve.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the\r\nimagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror. Have you\r\nseen the evening paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It gives a fairly good account of the affair. It does not mention the\r\nfact that when the man was raised up, a woman's wedding ring fell upon\r\nthe floor. It is just as well it does not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at this advertisement,\" he answered. \"I had one sent to every\r\npaper this morning immediately after the affair.\"\r\n\r\nHe threw the paper across to me and I glanced at the place indicated. It\r\nwas the first announcement in the \"Found\" column. \"In Brixton Road,\r\nthis morning,\" it ran, \"a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway\r\nbetween the 'White Hart' Tavern and Holland Grove. Apply Dr. Watson,\r\n221B, Baker Street, between eight and nine this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse my using your name,\" he said. \"If I used my own some of these\r\ndunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all right,\" I answered. \"But supposing anyone applies, I have\r\nno ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you have,\" said he, handing me one. \"This will do very well. It\r\nis almost a facsimile.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes.\r\nIf he does not come himself he will send an accomplice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would he not consider it as too dangerous?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason\r\nto believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the\r\nring. According to my notion he dropped it while stooping over Drebber's\r\nbody, and did not miss it at the time. After leaving the house he\r\ndiscovered his loss and hurried back, but found the police already in\r\npossession, owing to his own folly in leaving the candle burning. He had\r\nto pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have\r\nbeen aroused by his appearance at the gate. Now put yourself in that\r\nman's place. On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him\r\nthat it was possible that he had lost the ring in the road after leaving\r\nthe house. What would he do, then? He would eagerly look out for the\r\nevening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found. His\r\neye, of course, would light upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should\r\nhe fear a trap? There would be no reason in his eyes why the finding\r\nof the ring should be connected with the murder. He would come. He will\r\ncome. You shall see him within an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can leave me to deal with him then. Have you any arms?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better clean it and load it. He will be a desperate man,\r\nand though I shall take him unawares, it is as well to be ready for\r\nanything.\"\r\n\r\nI went to my bedroom and followed his advice. When I returned with\r\nthe pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his\r\nfavourite occupation of scraping upon his violin.\r\n\r\n\"The plot thickens,\" he said, as I entered; \"I have just had an answer\r\nto my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is?\" I asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"My fiddle would be the better for new strings,\" he remarked. \"Put your\r\npistol in your pocket. When the fellow comes speak to him in an ordinary\r\nway. Leave the rest to me. Don't frighten him by looking at him too\r\nhard.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is eight o'clock now,\" I said, glancing at my watch.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He will probably be here in a few minutes. Open the door slightly.\r\nThat will do. Now put the key on the inside. Thank you! This is a\r\nqueer old book I picked up at a stall yesterday--'De Jure inter\r\nGentes'--published in Latin at Liege in the Lowlands, in 1642. Charles'\r\nhead was still firm on his shoulders when this little brown-backed\r\nvolume was struck off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the printer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Philippe de Croy, whoever he may have been. On the fly-leaf, in very\r\nfaded ink, is written 'Ex libris Guliolmi Whyte.' I wonder who William\r\nWhyte was. Some pragmatical seventeenth century lawyer, I suppose. His\r\nwriting has a legal twist about it. Here comes our man, I think.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke there was a sharp ring at the bell. Sherlock Holmes rose\r\nsoftly and moved his chair in the direction of the door. We heard the\r\nservant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she\r\nopened it.\r\n\r\n\"Does Dr. Watson live here?\" asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We\r\ncould not hear the servant's reply, but the door closed, and some one\r\nbegan to ascend the stairs. The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling\r\none. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he\r\nlistened to it. It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble\r\ntap at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in,\" I cried.\r\n\r\nAt my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very\r\nold and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment. She appeared to be\r\ndazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she\r\nstood blinking at us with her bleared eyes and fumbling in her pocket\r\nwith nervous, shaky fingers. I glanced at my companion, and his face\r\nhad assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to\r\nkeep my countenance.\r\n\r\nThe old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our\r\nadvertisement. \"It's this as has brought me, good gentlemen,\" she said,\r\ndropping another curtsey; \"a gold wedding ring in the Brixton Road. It\r\nbelongs to my girl Sally, as was married only this time twelvemonth,\r\nwhich her husband is steward aboard a Union boat, and what he'd say if\r\nhe come 'ome and found her without her ring is more than I can think, he\r\nbeing short enough at the best o' times, but more especially when he\r\nhas the drink. If it please you, she went to the circus last night along\r\nwith----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that her ring?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Lord be thanked!\" cried the old woman; \"Sally will be a glad woman\r\nthis night. That's the ring.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what may your address be?\" I inquired, taking up a pencil.\r\n\r\n\"13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch. A weary way from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Brixton Road does not lie between any circus and Houndsditch,\" said\r\nSherlock Holmes sharply.\r\n\r\nThe old woman faced round and looked keenly at him from her little\r\nred-rimmed eyes. \"The gentleman asked me for _my_ address,\" she said.\r\n\"Sally lives in lodgings at 3, Mayfield Place, Peckham.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your name is----?\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Sawyer--her's is Dennis, which Tom Dennis married her--and\r\na smart, clean lad, too, as long as he's at sea, and no steward in the\r\ncompany more thought of; but when on shore, what with the women and what\r\nwith liquor shops----\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is your ring, Mrs. Sawyer,\" I interrupted, in obedience to a sign\r\nfrom my companion; \"it clearly belongs to your daughter, and I am glad\r\nto be able to restore it to the rightful owner.\"\r\n\r\nWith many mumbled blessings and protestations of gratitude the old crone\r\npacked it away in her pocket, and shuffled off down the stairs. Sherlock\r\nHolmes sprang to his feet the moment that she was gone and rushed into\r\nhis room. He returned in a few seconds enveloped in an ulster and\r\na cravat. \"I'll follow her,\" he said, hurriedly; \"she must be an\r\naccomplice, and will lead me to him. Wait up for me.\" The hall door had\r\nhardly slammed behind our visitor before Holmes had descended the stair.\r\nLooking through the window I could see her walking feebly along the\r\nother side, while her pursuer dogged her some little distance behind.\r\n\"Either his whole theory is incorrect,\" I thought to myself, \"or else he\r\nwill be led now to the heart of the mystery.\" There was no need for him\r\nto ask me to wait up for him, for I felt that sleep was impossible until\r\nI heard the result of his adventure.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon nine when he set out. I had no idea how long he might\r\nbe, but I sat stolidly puffing at my pipe and skipping over the pages\r\nof Henri Murger's \"Vie de Boheme.\" Ten o'clock passed, and I heard the\r\nfootsteps of the maid as they pattered off to bed. Eleven, and the\r\nmore stately tread of the landlady passed my door, bound for the same\r\ndestination. It was close upon twelve before I heard the sharp sound of\r\nhis latch-key. The instant he entered I saw by his face that he had not\r\nbeen successful. Amusement and chagrin seemed to be struggling for the\r\nmastery, until the former suddenly carried the day, and he burst into a\r\nhearty laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't have the Scotland Yarders know it for the world,\" he cried,\r\ndropping into his chair; \"I have chaffed them so much that they would\r\nnever have let me hear the end of it. I can afford to laugh, because I\r\nknow that I will be even with them in the long run.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind telling a story against myself. That creature had\r\ngone a little way when she began to limp and show every sign of being\r\nfoot-sore. Presently she came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which\r\nwas passing. I managed to be close to her so as to hear the address, but\r\nI need not have been so anxious, for she sang it out loud enough to\r\nbe heard at the other side of the street, 'Drive to 13, Duncan Street,\r\nHoundsditch,' she cried. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and\r\nhaving seen her safely inside, I perched myself behind. That's an art\r\nwhich every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and\r\nnever drew rein until we reached the street in question. I hopped off\r\nbefore we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy,\r\nlounging way. I saw the cab pull up. The driver jumped down, and I saw\r\nhim open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. When\r\nI reached him he was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and\r\ngiving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I\r\nlistened to. There was no sign or trace of his passenger, and I fear it\r\nwill be some time before he gets his fare. On inquiring at Number 13\r\nwe found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named\r\nKeswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever\r\nbeen heard of there.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say,\" I cried, in amazement, \"that that tottering,\r\nfeeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion,\r\nwithout either you or the driver seeing her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Old woman be damned!\" said Sherlock Holmes, sharply. \"We were the old\r\nwomen to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an\r\nactive one, too, besides being an incomparable actor. The get-up was\r\ninimitable. He saw that he was followed, no doubt, and used this means\r\nof giving me the slip. It shows that the man we are after is not as\r\nlonely as I imagined he was, but has friends who are ready to risk\r\nsomething for him. Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice\r\nand turn in.\"\r\n\r\nI was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his injunction. I\r\nleft Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the\r\nwatches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his violin,\r\nand knew that he was still pondering over the strange problem which he\r\nhad set himself to unravel.\r\n\nTHE papers next day were full of the \"Brixton Mystery,\" as they termed\r\nit. Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it\r\nin addition. There was some information in them which was new to me. I\r\nstill retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing\r\nupon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--\r\n\r\nThe _Daily Telegraph_ remarked that in the history of crime there had\r\nseldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The German\r\nname of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister\r\ninscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political\r\nrefugees and revolutionists. The Socialists had many branches in\r\nAmerica, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws,\r\nand been tracked down by them. After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht,\r\naqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian\r\ntheory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the\r\narticle concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer\r\nwatch over foreigners in England.\r\n\r\nThe _Standard_ commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort\r\nusually occurred under a Liberal Administration. They arose from the\r\nunsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening\r\nof all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had\r\nbeen residing for some weeks in the Metropolis. He had stayed at the\r\nboarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell.\r\nHe was accompanied in his travels by his private secretary, Mr. Joseph\r\nStangerson. The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the\r\n4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of\r\ncatching the Liverpool express. They were afterwards seen together upon\r\nthe platform. Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body\r\nwas, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road,\r\nmany miles from Euston. How he came there, or how he met his fate, are\r\nquestions which are still involved in mystery. Nothing is known of the\r\nwhereabouts of Stangerson. We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and\r\nMr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it\r\nis confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily\r\nthrow light upon the matter.\r\n\r\nThe _Daily News_ observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being\r\na political one. The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated\r\nthe Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores\r\na number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not\r\nsoured by the recollection of all that they had undergone. Among these\r\nmen there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was\r\npunished by death. Every effort should be made to find the secretary,\r\nStangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the\r\ndeceased. A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address\r\nof the house at which he had boarded--a result which was entirely due to\r\nthe acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and\r\nthey appeared to afford him considerable amusement.\r\n\r\n\"I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure\r\nto score.\"\r\n\r\n\"That depends on how it turns out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. If the man is caught, it\r\nwill be _on account_ of their exertions; if he escapes, it will be _in\r\nspite_ of their exertions. It's heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever\r\nthey do, they will have followers. 'Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot\r\nqui l'admire.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What on earth is this?\" I cried, for at this moment there came the\r\npattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by\r\naudible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force,\" said my\r\ncompanion, gravely; and as he spoke there rushed into the room half a\r\ndozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped\r\neyes on.\r\n\r\n\"'Tention!\" cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little\r\nscoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes. \"In\r\nfuture you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you\r\nmust wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, we hain't,\" said one of the youths.\r\n\r\n\"I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do. Here are\r\nyour wages.\" [13] He handed each of them a shilling.\r\n\r\n\"Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats,\r\nand we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.\r\n\r\n\"There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than\r\nout of a dozen of the force,\" Holmes remarked. \"The mere sight of an\r\nofficial-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go\r\neverywhere and hear everything. They are as sharp as needles, too; all\r\nthey want is organisation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter\r\nof time. Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance!\r\nHere is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every\r\nfeature of his face. Bound for us, I know. Yes, he is stopping. There he\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the\r\nfair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and\r\nburst into our sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" he cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand,\r\n\"congratulate me! I have made the whole thing as clear as day.\"\r\n\r\nA shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that you are on the right track?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his name is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her Majesty's navy,\" cried\r\nGregson, pompously, rubbing his fat hands and inflating his chest.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,\" he said. \"We are anxious to\r\nknow how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't mind if I do,\" the detective answered. \"The tremendous\r\nexertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn\r\nme out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon\r\nthe mind. You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both\r\nbrain-workers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do me too much honour,\" said Holmes, gravely. \"Let us hear how you\r\narrived at this most gratifying result.\"\r\n\r\nThe detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently\r\nat his cigar. Then suddenly he slapped his thigh in a paroxysm of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n\"The fun of it is,\" he cried, \"that that fool Lestrade, who thinks\r\nhimself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether. He is\r\nafter the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime\r\nthan the babe unborn. I have no doubt that he has caught him by this\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea tickled Gregson so much that he laughed until he choked.\r\n\r\n\"And how did you get your clue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is\r\nstrictly between ourselves. The first difficulty which we had to contend\r\nwith was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some people would\r\nhave waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties\r\ncame forward and volunteered information. That is not Tobias Gregson's\r\nway of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Holmes; \"by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.\"\r\n\r\nGregson looked quite crest-fallen.\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea that you noticed that,\" he said. \"Have you been there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; \"you should never neglect a\r\nchance, however small it may seem.\"\r\n\r\n\"To a great mind, nothing is little,\" remarked Holmes, sententiously.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him if he had sold a hat of that\r\nsize and description. He looked over his books, and came on it at once.\r\nHe had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier's Boarding\r\nEstablishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his address.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smart--very smart!\" murmured Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"I next called upon Madame Charpentier,\" continued the detective.\r\n\"I found her very pale and distressed. Her daughter was in the room,\r\ntoo--an uncommonly fine girl she is, too; she was looking red about\r\nthe eyes and her lips trembled as I spoke to her. That didn't escape\r\nmy notice. I began to smell a rat. You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your\r\nnerves. 'Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr.\r\nEnoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"The mother nodded. She didn't seem able to get out a word. The daughter\r\nburst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something\r\nof the matter.\r\n\r\n\"'At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"'At eight o'clock,' she said, gulping in her throat to keep down her\r\nagitation. 'His secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two\r\ntrains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He was to catch the first. [14]\r\n\r\n\"'And was that the last which you saw of him?'\r\n\r\n\"A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question.\r\nHer features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she\r\ncould get out the single word 'Yes'--and when it did come it was in a\r\nhusky unnatural tone.\r\n\r\n\"There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm\r\nclear voice.\r\n\r\n\"'No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,' she said. 'Let us be\r\nfrank with this gentleman. We _did_ see Mr. Drebber again.'\r\n\r\n\"'God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her hands and\r\nsinking back in her chair. 'You have murdered your brother.'\r\n\r\n\"'Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered\r\nfirmly.\r\n\r\n\"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences are\r\nworse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.'\r\n\r\n\"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to me,\r\n'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf\r\nof my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand in this\r\nterrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however,\r\nthat in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to be\r\ncompromised. That however is surely impossible. His high character, his\r\nprofession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'\r\n\r\n\"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.\r\n'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'\r\n\r\n\"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and her\r\ndaughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention of\r\ntelling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I\r\nhave no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all\r\nwithout omitting any particular.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is your wisest course,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his secretary,\r\nMr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I noticed a\r\n\"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been\r\ntheir last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his\r\nemployer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise. He was coarse in his\r\nhabits and brutish in his ways. The very night of his arrival he became\r\nvery much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o'clock in the\r\nday he could hardly ever be said to be sober. His manners towards the\r\nmaid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar. Worst of all, he\r\nspeedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke\r\nto her more than once in a way which, fortunately, she is too innocent\r\nto understand. On one occasion he actually seized her in his arms and\r\nembraced her--an outrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him\r\nfor his unmanly conduct.'\r\n\r\n\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can get\r\nrid of your boarders when you wish.'\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God that\r\nI had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said. 'But\r\nit was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen\r\npounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a widow, and my boy in\r\nthe Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the\r\nbest. This last was too much, however, and I gave him notice to leave on\r\naccount of it. That was the reason of his going.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well?'\r\n\r\n\"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\r\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\r\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed the\r\ndoor behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas, in\r\nless than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr.\r\nDrebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the worse for\r\ndrink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting with my\r\ndaughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his train.\r\nHe then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her that\r\nshe should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and there is no law\r\nto stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never mind the old girl\r\nhere, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a\r\nprincess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she shrunk away from him,\r\nbut he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her towards the\r\ndoor. I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room.\r\nWhat happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds\r\nof a scuffle. I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up\r\nI saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his hand.\r\n\"I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will\r\njust go after him and see what he does with himself.\" With those words\r\nhe took his hat and started off down the street. The next morning we\r\nheard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.'\r\n\r\n\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\r\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words. I\r\nmade shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that there should\r\nbe no possibility of a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What happened\r\nnext?\"\r\n\r\n\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that the\r\nwhole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way which\r\nI always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour her son\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\"'I do not know,' she answered.\r\n\r\n\"'Not know?'\r\n\r\n\"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'\r\n\r\n\"'After you went to bed?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'When did you go to bed?'\r\n\r\n\"'About eleven.'\r\n\r\n\"'So your son was gone at least two hours?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'Possibly four or five?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.'\r\n\r\n\"'What was he doing during that time?'\r\n\r\n\"'I do not know,' she answered, turning white to her very lips.\r\n\r\n\"Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found\r\nout where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and\r\narrested him. When I touched him on the shoulder and warned him to come\r\nquietly with us, he answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you\r\nare arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel\r\nDrebber,' he said. We had said nothing to him about it, so that his\r\nalluding to it had a most suspicious aspect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"He still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him as\r\nhaving with him when he followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your theory, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my theory is that he followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.\r\nWhen there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of\r\nwhich Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach,\r\nperhaps, which killed him without leaving any mark. The night was so\r\nwet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his victim\r\ninto the empty house. As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing\r\non the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the\r\npolice on to the wrong scent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well done!\" said Holmes in an encouraging voice. \"Really, Gregson, you\r\nare getting along. We shall make something of you yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,\" the detective\r\nanswered proudly. \"The young man volunteered a statement, in which he\r\nsaid that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him,\r\nand took a cab in order to get away from him. On his way home he met an\r\nold shipmate, and took a long walk with him. On being asked where this\r\nold shipmate lived, he was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I\r\nthink the whole case fits together uncommonly well. What amuses me is to\r\nthink of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid\r\nhe won't make much of [15] Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself!\"\r\n\r\nIt was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were\r\ntalking, and who now entered the room. The assurance and jauntiness\r\nwhich generally marked his demeanour and dress were, however, wanting.\r\nHis face was disturbed and troubled, while his clothes were disarranged\r\nand untidy. He had evidently come with the intention of consulting\r\nwith Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his colleague he appeared to be\r\nembarrassed and put out. He stood in the centre of the room, fumbling\r\nnervously with his hat and uncertain what to do. \"This is a most\r\nextraordinary case,\" he said at last--\"a most incomprehensible affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade!\" cried Gregson, triumphantly. \"I\r\nthought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the\r\nSecretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,\" said Lestrade gravely, \"was\r\nmurdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning.\"\r\n\nTHE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so\r\nunexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered. Gregson sprang\r\nout of his chair and upset the remainder of his whiskey and water. I\r\nstared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his\r\nbrows drawn down over his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Stangerson too!\" he muttered. \"The plot thickens.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was quite thick enough before,\" grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.\r\n\"I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?\" stammered\r\nGregson.\r\n\r\n\"I have just come from his room,\" said Lestrade. \"I was the first to\r\ndiscover what had occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,\" Holmes observed.\r\n\"Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no objection,\" Lestrade answered, seating himself. \"I freely\r\nconfess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in\r\nthe death of Drebber. This fresh development has shown me that I was\r\ncompletely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out\r\nwhat had become of the Secretary. They had been seen together at Euston\r\nStation about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the\r\nmorning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road. The question which\r\nconfronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between\r\n8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him afterwards.\r\nI telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning\r\nthem to keep a watch upon the American boats. I then set to work calling\r\nupon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. You\r\nsee, I argued that if Drebber and his companion had become separated,\r\nthe natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the\r\nvicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,\"\r\nremarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making\r\nenquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and\r\nat eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George\r\nStreet. On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there,\r\nthey at once answered me in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"'No doubt you are the gentleman whom he was expecting,' they said. 'He\r\nhas been waiting for a gentleman for two days.'\r\n\r\n\"'Where is he now?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'He is upstairs in bed. He wished to be called at nine.'\r\n\r\n\"'I will go up and see him at once,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his nerves and\r\nlead him to say something unguarded. The Boots volunteered to show me\r\nthe room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor\r\nleading up to it. The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to\r\ngo downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in\r\nspite of my twenty years' experience. From under the door there curled\r\na little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and\r\nformed a little pool along the skirting at the other side. I gave a cry,\r\nwhich brought the Boots back. He nearly fainted when he saw it. The door\r\nwas locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it\r\nin. The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled\r\nup, lay the body of a man in his nightdress. He was quite dead, and had\r\nbeen for some time, for his limbs were rigid and cold. When we turned\r\nhim over, the Boots recognized him at once as being the same gentleman\r\nwho had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson. The cause\r\nof death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated\r\nthe heart. And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you\r\nsuppose was above the murdered man?\"\r\n\r\nI felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror,\r\neven before Sherlock Holmes answered.\r\n\r\n\"The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That was it,\" said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all\r\nsilent for a while.\r\n\r\nThere was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the\r\ndeeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to\r\nhis crimes. My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle\r\ntingled as I thought of it.\r\n\r\n\"The man was seen,\" continued Lestrade. \"A milk boy, passing on his way\r\nto the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews\r\nat the back of the hotel. He noticed that a ladder, which usually lay\r\nthere, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which\r\nwas wide open. After passing, he looked back and saw a man descend the\r\nladder. He came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him to\r\nbe some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel. He took no particular\r\nnotice of him, beyond thinking in his own mind that it was early for him\r\nto be at work. He has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish\r\nface, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat. He must have stayed in\r\nthe room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained\r\nwater in the basin, where he had washed his hands, and marks on the\r\nsheets where he had deliberately wiped his knife.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which\r\ntallied so exactly with his own. There was, however, no trace of\r\nexultation or satisfaction upon his face.\r\n\r\n\"Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the\r\nmurderer?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his pocket, but it seems\r\nthat this was usual, as he did all the paying. There was eighty odd\r\npounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these\r\nextraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them. There were\r\nno papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single\r\ntelegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing\r\nthe words, 'J. H. is in Europe.' There was no name appended to this\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there was nothing else?\" Holmes asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of any importance. The man's novel, with which he had read\r\nhimself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his pipe was on a chair\r\nbeside him. There was a glass of water on the table, and on the\r\nwindow-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sprang from his chair with an exclamation of delight.\r\n\r\n\"The last link,\" he cried, exultantly. \"My case is complete.\"\r\n\r\nThe two detectives stared at him in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"I have now in my hands,\" my companion said, confidently, \"all the\r\nthreads which have formed such a tangle. There are, of course, details\r\nto be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the\r\ntime that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the\r\ndiscovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own\r\neyes. I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand\r\nupon those pills?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have them,\" said Lestrade, producing a small white box; \"I took them\r\nand the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of\r\nsafety at the Police Station. It was the merest chance my taking these\r\npills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give them here,\" said Holmes. \"Now, Doctor,\" turning to me, \"are those\r\nordinary pills?\"\r\n\r\nThey certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small,\r\nround, and almost transparent against the light. \"From their lightness\r\nand transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,\" I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"Precisely so,\" answered Holmes. \"Now would you mind going down and\r\nfetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long,\r\nand which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.\"\r\n\r\nI went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It's laboured\r\nbreathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.\r\nIndeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded\r\nthe usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the\r\nrug.\r\n\r\n\"I will now cut one of these pills in two,\" said Holmes, and drawing his\r\npenknife he suited the action to the word. \"One half we return into the\r\nbox for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass,\r\nin which is a teaspoonful of water. You perceive that our friend, the\r\nDoctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves.\"\r\n\r\n\"This may be very interesting,\" said Lestrade, in the injured tone of\r\none who suspects that he is being laughed at, \"I cannot see, however,\r\nwhat it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has\r\neverything to do with it. I shall now add a little milk to make the\r\nmixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he laps\r\nit up readily enough.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and\r\nplaced it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry. Sherlock\r\nHolmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in\r\nsilence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling\r\neffect. None such appeared, however. The dog continued to lie stretched\r\nupon tho [16] cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently\r\nneither the better nor the worse for its draught.\r\n\r\nHolmes had taken out his watch, and as minute followed minute without\r\nresult, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared\r\nupon his features. He gnawed his lip, drummed his fingers upon the\r\ntable, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience. So great\r\nwas his emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him, while the two\r\ndetectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which\r\nhe had met.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be a coincidence,\" he cried, at last springing from his chair\r\nand pacing wildly up and down the room; \"it is impossible that it should\r\nbe a mere coincidence. The very pills which I suspected in the case of\r\nDrebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they\r\nare inert. What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot\r\nhave been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the\r\nworse. Ah, I have it! I have it!\" With a perfect shriek of delight he\r\nrushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk,\r\nand presented it to the terrier. The unfortunate creature's tongue\r\nseemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive\r\nshiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been\r\nstruck by lightning.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his\r\nforehead. \"I should have more faith,\" he said; \"I ought to know by\r\nthis time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of\r\ndeductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other\r\ninterpretation. Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly\r\npoison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that\r\nbefore ever I saw the box at all.\"\r\n\r\nThis last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could\r\nhardly believe that he was in his sober senses. There was the dead dog,\r\nhowever, to prove that his conjecture had been correct. It seemed to me\r\nthat the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began\r\nto have a dim, vague perception of the truth.\r\n\r\n\"All this seems strange to you,\" continued Holmes, \"because you failed\r\nat the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single\r\nreal clue which was presented to you. I had the good fortune to seize\r\nupon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to\r\nconfirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence\r\nof it. Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more\r\nobscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.\r\nIt is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery. The most\r\ncommonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no\r\nnew or special features from which deductions may be drawn. This murder\r\nwould have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of\r\nthe victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of\r\nthose _outre_ and sensational accompaniments which have rendered\r\nit remarkable. These strange details, far from making the case more\r\ndifficult, have really had the effect of making it less so.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable\r\nimpatience, could contain himself no longer. \"Look here, Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes,\" he said, \"we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart\r\nman, and that you have your own methods of working. We want something\r\nmore than mere theory and preaching now, though. It is a case of taking\r\nthe man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young\r\nCharpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair. Lestrade\r\nwent after his man, Stangerson, and it appears that he was wrong too.\r\nYou have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more\r\nthan we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to\r\nask you straight how much you do know of the business. Can you name the\r\nman who did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,\" remarked Lestrade.\r\n\"We have both tried, and we have both failed. You have remarked more\r\nthan once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence\r\nwhich you require. Surely you will not withhold it any longer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any delay in arresting the assassin,\" I observed, \"might give him time\r\nto perpetrate some fresh atrocity.\"\r\n\r\nThus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. He\r\ncontinued to walk up and down the room with his head sunk on his chest\r\nand his brows drawn down, as was his habit when lost in thought.\r\n\r\n\"There will be no more murders,\" he said at last, stopping abruptly and\r\nfacing us. \"You can put that consideration out of the question. You have\r\nasked me if I know the name of the assassin. I do. The mere knowing of\r\nhis name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying\r\nour hands upon him. This I expect very shortly to do. I have good hopes\r\nof managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which\r\nneeds delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal\r\nwith, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who\r\nis as clever as himself. As long as this man has no idea that anyone\r\ncan have a clue there is some chance of securing him; but if he had the\r\nslightest suspicion, he would change his name, and vanish in an instant\r\namong the four million inhabitants of this great city. Without meaning\r\nto hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these\r\nmen to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I\r\nhave not asked your assistance. If I fail I shall, of course, incur all\r\nthe blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for. At present\r\nI am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you\r\nwithout endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.\"\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance,\r\nor by the depreciating allusion to the detective police. The former had\r\nflushed up to the roots of his flaxen hair, while the other's beady eyes\r\nglistened with curiosity and resentment. Neither of them had time to\r\nspeak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman\r\nof the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his insignificant and\r\nunsavoury person.\r\n\r\n\"Please, sir,\" he said, touching his forelock, \"I have the cab\r\ndownstairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good boy,\" said Holmes, blandly. \"Why don't you introduce this pattern\r\nat Scotland Yard?\" he continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from\r\na drawer. \"See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an\r\ninstant.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old pattern is good enough,\" remarked Lestrade, \"if we can only\r\nfind the man to put them on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, very good,\" said Holmes, smiling. \"The cabman may as well\r\nhelp me with my boxes. Just ask him to step up, Wiggins.\"\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he were about\r\nto set out on a journey, since he had not said anything to me about it.\r\nThere was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he pulled out and\r\nbegan to strap. He was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,\" he said, kneeling over\r\nhis task, and never turning his head.\r\n\r\nThe fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put\r\ndown his hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the\r\njangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his feet again.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he cried, with flashing eyes, \"let me introduce you to Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time\r\nto realize it. I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes'\r\ntriumphant expression and the ring of his voice, of the cabman's\r\ndazed, savage face, as he glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had\r\nappeared as if by magic upon his wrists. For a second or two we might\r\nhave been a group of statues. Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury,\r\nthe prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled\r\nhimself through the window. Woodwork and glass gave way before him; but\r\nbefore he got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon\r\nhim like so many staghounds. He was dragged back into the room, and then\r\ncommenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he, that\r\nthe four of us were shaken off again and again. He appeared to have the\r\nconvulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. His face and hands\r\nwere terribly mangled by his passage through the glass, but loss of\r\nblood had no effect in diminishing his resistance. It was not until\r\nLestrade succeeded in getting his hand inside his neckcloth and\r\nhalf-strangling him that we made him realize that his struggles were of\r\nno avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his\r\nfeet as well as his hands. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and\r\npanting.\r\n\r\n\"We have his cab,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"It will serve to take him to\r\nScotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,\" he continued, with a pleasant smile,\r\n\"we have reached the end of our little mystery. You are very welcome to\r\nput any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I\r\nwill refuse to answer them.\"\r\n\nIN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies\r\nan arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a\r\nbarrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra Nevada to\r\nNebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado\r\nupon the south, is a region of desolation and silence. Nor is Nature\r\nalways in one mood throughout this grim district. It comprises\r\nsnow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. There are\r\nswift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged canons; and there are\r\nenormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are\r\ngrey with the saline alkali dust. They all preserve, however, the common\r\ncharacteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.\r\n\r\nThere are no inhabitants of this land of despair. A band of Pawnees\r\nor of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other\r\nhunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight\r\nof those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their\r\nprairies. The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily\r\nthrough the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark\r\nravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks. These\r\nare the sole dwellers in the wilderness.\r\n\r\nIn the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from\r\nthe northern slope of the Sierra Blanco. As far as the eye can reach\r\nstretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of\r\nalkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes. On\r\nthe extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks,\r\nwith their rugged summits flecked with snow. In this great stretch of\r\ncountry there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.\r\nThere is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull,\r\ngrey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. Listen as one may,\r\nthere is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but\r\nsilence--complete and heart-subduing silence.\r\n\r\nIt has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad\r\nplain. That is hardly true. Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one\r\nsees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is\r\nlost in the extreme distance. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down\r\nby the feet of many adventurers. Here and there there are scattered\r\nwhite objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull\r\ndeposit of alkali. Approach, and examine them! They are bones: some\r\nlarge and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have\r\nbelonged to oxen, and the latter to men. For fifteen hundred miles one\r\nmay trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those\r\nwho had fallen by the wayside.\r\n\r\nLooking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May,\r\neighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His appearance\r\nwas such that he might have been the very genius or demon of the region.\r\nAn observer would have found it difficult to say whether he was nearer\r\nto forty or to sixty. His face was lean and haggard, and the brown\r\nparchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his\r\nlong, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his\r\neyes were sunken in his head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while\r\nthe hand which grasped his rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a\r\nskeleton. As he stood, he leaned upon his weapon for support, and yet\r\nhis tall figure and the massive framework of his bones suggested a wiry\r\nand vigorous constitution. His gaunt face, however, and his clothes,\r\nwhich hung so baggily over his shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it\r\nwas that gave him that senile and decrepit appearance. The man was\r\ndying--dying from hunger and from thirst.\r\n\r\nHe had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little\r\nelevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water. Now the great\r\nsalt plain stretched before his eyes, and the distant belt of savage\r\nmountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might\r\nindicate the presence of moisture. In all that broad landscape there\r\nwas no gleam of hope. North, and east, and west he looked with wild\r\nquestioning eyes, and then he realised that his wanderings had come to\r\nan end, and that there, on that barren crag, he was about to die. \"Why\r\nnot here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,\" he muttered,\r\nas he seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.\r\n\r\nBefore sitting down, he had deposited upon the ground his useless rifle,\r\nand also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he had carried\r\nslung over his right shoulder. It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for\r\nhis strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some\r\nlittle violence. Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little\r\nmoaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very\r\nbright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.\r\n\r\n\"You've hurt me!\" said a childish voice reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"Have I though,\" the man answered penitently, \"I didn't go for to do\r\nit.\" As he spoke he unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty\r\nlittle girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart\r\npink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care. The\r\nchild was pale and wan, but her healthy arms and legs showed that she\r\nhad suffered less than her companion.\r\n\r\n\"How is it now?\" he answered anxiously, for she was still rubbing the\r\ntowsy golden curls which covered the back of her head.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss it and make it well,\" she said, with perfect gravity, shoving\r\n[19] the injured part up to him. \"That's what mother used to do. Where's\r\nmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone, eh!\" said the little girl. \"Funny, she didn't say good-bye; she\r\n'most always did if she was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and now\r\nshe's been away three days. Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't there\r\nno water, nor nothing to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient awhile,\r\nand then you'll be all right. Put your head up agin me like that, and\r\nthen you'll feel bullier. It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like\r\nleather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie. What's\r\nthat you've got?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pretty things! fine things!\" cried the little girl enthusiastically,\r\nholding up two glittering fragments of mica. \"When we goes back to home\r\nI'll give them to brother Bob.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see prettier things than them soon,\" said the man confidently.\r\n\"You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though--you remember when\r\nwe left the river?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see. But there\r\nwas somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't\r\nturn up. Water ran out. Just except a little drop for the likes of you\r\nand--and----\"\r\n\r\n\"And you couldn't wash yourself,\" interrupted his companion gravely,\r\nstaring up at his grimy visage.\r\n\r\n\"No, nor drink. And Mr. Bender, he was the fust to go, and then Indian\r\nPete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie,\r\nyour mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then mother's a deader too,\" cried the little girl dropping her face in\r\nher pinafore and sobbing bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they all went except you and me. Then I thought there was some\r\nchance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and\r\nwe tramped it together. It don't seem as though we've improved matters.\r\nThere's an almighty small chance for us now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that we are going to die too?\" asked the child, checking\r\nher sobs, and raising her tear-stained face.\r\n\r\n\"I guess that's about the size of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you say so before?\" she said, laughing gleefully. \"You gave\r\nme such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with\r\nmother again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you will, dearie.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you too. I'll tell her how awful good you've been. I'll bet she\r\nmeets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot\r\nof buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was\r\nfond of. How long will it be first?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--not very long.\" The man's eyes were fixed upon the\r\nnorthern horizon. In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared\r\nthree little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did\r\nthey approach. They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown\r\nbirds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then\r\nsettled upon some rocks which overlooked them. They were buzzards, the\r\nvultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.\r\n\r\n\"Cocks and hens,\" cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their\r\nill-omened forms, and clapping her hands to make them rise. \"Say, did\r\nGod make this country?\"\r\n\r\n\"In course He did,\" said her companion, rather startled by this\r\nunexpected question.\r\n\r\n\"He made the country down in Illinois, and He made the Missouri,\" the\r\nlittle girl continued. \"I guess somebody else made the country in these\r\nparts. It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the\r\ntrees.\"\r\n\r\n\"What would ye think of offering up prayer?\" the man asked diffidently.\r\n\r\n\"It ain't night yet,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He won't mind that, you\r\nbet. You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the\r\nwaggon when we was on the Plains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you say some yourself?\" the child asked, with wondering eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I disremember them,\" he answered. \"I hain't said none since I was half\r\nthe height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out,\r\nand I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,\" she said, laying the shawl\r\nout for that purpose. \"You've got to put your hands up like this. It\r\nmakes you feel kind o' good.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see\r\nit. Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little\r\nprattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. Her chubby face,\r\nand his haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless\r\nheaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were\r\nface to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other\r\ndeep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness. The\r\nprayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder\r\nuntil the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her\r\nprotector. He watched over her slumber for some time, but Nature proved\r\nto be too strong for him. For three days and three nights he had allowed\r\nhimself neither rest nor repose. Slowly the eyelids drooped over the\r\ntired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the\r\nman's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his companion,\r\nand both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nHad the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight\r\nwould have met his eyes. Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali\r\nplain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and\r\nhardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually\r\ngrowing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud.\r\nThis cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it\r\ncould only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures. In more\r\nfertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one\r\nof those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was\r\napproaching him. This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. As\r\nthe whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two\r\ncastaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the\r\nfigures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the\r\napparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for\r\nthe West. But what a caravan! When the head of it had reached the base\r\nof the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon. Right\r\nacross the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons\r\nand carts, men on horseback, and men on foot. Innumerable women who\r\nstaggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the\r\nwaggons or peeped out from under the white coverings. This was evidently\r\nno ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had\r\nbeen compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new\r\ncountry. There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and\r\nrumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels\r\nand the neighing of horses. Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to\r\nrouse the two tired wayfarers above them.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced\r\nmen, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles. On reaching\r\nthe base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"The wells are to the right, my brothers,\" said one, a hard-lipped,\r\nclean-shaven man with grizzly hair.\r\n\r\n\"To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,\"\r\nsaid another.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not for water,\" cried a third. \"He who could draw it from the\r\nrocks will not now abandon His own chosen people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen! Amen!\" responded the whole party.\r\n\r\nThey were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and\r\nkeenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag\r\nabove them. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink,\r\nshowing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind. At the sight\r\nthere was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while\r\nfresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard. The word\r\n'Redskins' was on every lip.\r\n\r\n\"There can't be any number of Injuns here,\" said the elderly man who\r\nappeared to be in command. \"We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no\r\nother tribes until we cross the great mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,\" asked one of the band.\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" \"and I,\" cried a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\"Leave your horses below and we will await you here,\" the Elder\r\nanswered. In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their\r\nhorses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the\r\nobject which had excited their curiosity. They advanced rapidly and\r\nnoiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts.\r\nThe watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock\r\nuntil their figures stood out against the skyline. The young man who had\r\nfirst given the alarm was leading them. Suddenly his followers saw him\r\nthrow up his hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining\r\nhim they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nOn the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a\r\nsingle giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man,\r\nlong-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness. His placid\r\nface and regular breathing showed that he was fast asleep. Beside him\r\nlay a little child, with her round white arms encircling his brown\r\nsinewy neck, and her golden haired head resting upon the breast of his\r\nvelveteen tunic. Her rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of\r\nsnow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her infantile\r\nfeatures. Her plump little white legs terminating in white socks and\r\nneat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long\r\nshrivelled members of her companion. On the ledge of rock above this\r\nstrange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of\r\nthe new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped\r\nsullenly away.\r\n\r\nThe cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about [20]\r\nthem in bewilderment. The man staggered to his feet and looked down upon\r\nthe plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him, and\r\nwhich was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts. His\r\nface assumed an expression of incredulity as he gazed, and he passed his\r\nboney hand over his eyes. \"This is what they call delirium, I guess,\"\r\nhe muttered. The child stood beside him, holding on to the skirt of\r\nhis coat, and said nothing but looked all round her with the wondering\r\nquestioning gaze of childhood.\r\n\r\nThe rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that\r\ntheir appearance was no delusion. One of them seized the little girl,\r\nand hoisted her upon his shoulder, while two others supported her gaunt\r\ncompanion, and assisted him towards the waggons.\r\n\r\n\"My name is John Ferrier,\" the wanderer explained; \"me and that little\r\nun are all that's left o' twenty-one people. The rest is all dead o'\r\nthirst and hunger away down in the south.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is she your child?\" asked someone.\r\n\r\n\"I guess she is now,\" the other cried, defiantly; \"she's mine 'cause I\r\nsaved her. No man will take her from me. She's Lucy Ferrier from this\r\nday on. Who are you, though?\" he continued, glancing with curiosity at\r\nhis stalwart, sunburned rescuers; \"there seems to be a powerful lot of\r\nye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nigh upon ten thousand,\" said one of the young men; \"we are the\r\npersecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard tell on him,\" said the wanderer. \"He appears to have\r\nchosen a fair crowd of ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not jest at that which is sacred,\" said the other sternly. \"We are\r\nof those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters\r\non plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith\r\nat Palmyra. We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we\r\nhad founded our temple. We have come to seek a refuge from the violent\r\nman and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. \"I\r\nsee,\" he said, \"you are the Mormons.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are the Mormons,\" answered his companions with one voice.\r\n\r\n\"And where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our\r\nProphet. You must come before him. He shall say what is to be done with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThey had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded\r\nby crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women, strong\r\nlaughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men. Many were the cries\r\nof astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they\r\nperceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the\r\nother. Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by\r\na great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was\r\nconspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of\r\nits appearance. Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were\r\nfurnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece. Beside the driver there\r\nsat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but\r\nwhose massive head and resolute expression marked him as a leader. He\r\nwas reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he laid\r\nit aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode. Then he\r\nturned to the two castaways.\r\n\r\n\"If we take you with us,\" he said, in solemn words, \"it can only be as\r\nbelievers in our own creed. We shall have no wolves in our fold. Better\r\nfar that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you\r\nshould prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the\r\nwhole fruit. Will you come with us on these terms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Guess I'll come with you on any terms,\" said Ferrier, with such\r\nemphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile. The leader\r\nalone retained his stern, impressive expression.\r\n\r\n\"Take him, Brother Stangerson,\" he said, \"give him food and drink,\r\nand the child likewise. Let it be your task also to teach him our holy\r\ncreed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!\"\r\n\r\n\"On, on to Zion!\" cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down\r\nthe long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a\r\ndull murmur in the far distance. With a cracking of whips and a creaking\r\nof wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan\r\nwas winding along once more. The Elder to whose care the two waifs\r\nhad been committed, led them to his waggon, where a meal was already\r\nawaiting them.\r\n\r\n\"You shall remain here,\" he said. \"In a few days you will have recovered\r\nfrom your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you\r\nare of our religion. Brigham Young has said it, and he has spoken with\r\nthe voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.\"\r\n\nTHIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured\r\nby the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven. From the\r\nshores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains\r\nthey had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.\r\nThe savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and\r\ndisease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all\r\nbeen overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity. Yet the long journey and the\r\naccumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.\r\nThere was not one who did not sink upon his knees in heartfelt prayer\r\nwhen they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath\r\nthem, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the\r\npromised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\nYoung speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a\r\nresolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future\r\ncity was sketched out. All around farms were apportioned and allotted in\r\nproportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put\r\nto his trade and the artisan to his calling. In the town streets and\r\nsquares sprang up, as if by magic. In the country there was draining\r\nand hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole\r\ncountry golden with the wheat crop. Everything prospered in the strange\r\nsettlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the\r\ncentre of the city grew ever taller and larger. From the first blush of\r\ndawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer\r\nand the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the\r\nimmigrants erected to Him who had led them safe through many dangers.\r\n\r\nThe two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his\r\nfortunes and had been adopted as his daughter, accompanied the Mormons\r\nto the end of their great pilgrimage. Little Lucy Ferrier was borne\r\nalong pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat which\r\nshe shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his son, a headstrong\r\nforward boy of twelve. Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood,\r\nfrom the shock caused by her mother's death, she soon became a pet\r\nwith the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her moving\r\ncanvas-covered home. In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his\r\nprivations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable\r\nhunter. So rapidly did he gain the esteem of his new companions, that\r\nwhen they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed\r\nthat he should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land\r\nas any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of\r\nStangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal\r\nElders.\r\n\r\nOn the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial\r\nlog-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it\r\ngrew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,\r\nkeen in his dealings and skilful with his hands. His iron constitution\r\nenabled him to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his\r\nlands. Hence it came about that his farm and all that belonged to\r\nhim prospered exceedingly. In three years he was better off than his\r\nneighbours, in six he was well-to-do, in nine he was rich, and in twelve\r\nthere were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could\r\ncompare with him. From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch\r\nMountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.\r\n\r\nThere was one way and only one in which he offended the susceptibilities\r\nof his co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him\r\nto set up a female establishment after the manner of his companions. He\r\nnever gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by\r\nresolutely and inflexibly adhering to his determination. There were some\r\nwho accused him of lukewarmness in his adopted religion, and others who\r\nput it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense. Others,\r\nagain, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who\r\nhad pined away on the shores of the Atlantic. Whatever the reason,\r\nFerrier remained strictly celibate. In every other respect he conformed\r\nto the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an\r\northodox and straight-walking man.\r\n\r\nLucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her adopted\r\nfather in all his undertakings. The keen air of the mountains and the\r\nbalsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to\r\nthe young girl. As year succeeded to year she grew taller and stronger,\r\nher cheek more rudy, and her step more elastic. Many a wayfarer upon\r\nthe high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts\r\nrevive in their mind as they watched her lithe girlish figure tripping\r\nthrough the wheatfields, or met her mounted upon her father's mustang,\r\nand managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.\r\nSo the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her father\r\nthe richest of the farmers left her as fair a specimen of American\r\ngirlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.\r\n\r\nIt was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had\r\ndeveloped into the woman. It seldom is in such cases. That mysterious\r\nchange is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. Least of\r\nall does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the\r\ntouch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her, and she learns,\r\nwith a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has\r\nawoken within her. There are few who cannot recall that day and remember\r\nthe one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life. In the\r\ncase of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart\r\nfrom its future influence on her destiny and that of many besides.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as\r\nthe bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem. In the fields and\r\nin the streets rose the same hum of human industry. Down the dusty high\r\nroads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the\r\nwest, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland\r\nRoute lay through the City of the Elect. There, too, were droves of\r\nsheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains\r\nof tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable\r\njourney. Through all this motley assemblage, threading her way with the\r\nskill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her fair\r\nface flushed with the exercise and her long chestnut hair floating out\r\nbehind her. She had a commission from her father in the City, and was\r\ndashing in as she had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness\r\nof youth, thinking only of her task and how it was to be performed. The\r\ntravel-stained adventurers gazed after her in astonishment, and even\r\nthe unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their\r\naccustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced\r\nmaiden.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the outskirts of the city when she found the road\r\nblocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking\r\nherdsmen from the plains. In her impatience she endeavoured to pass this\r\nobstacle by pushing her horse into what appeared to be a gap. Scarcely\r\nhad she got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind\r\nher, and she found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of\r\nfierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks. Accustomed as she was to deal with\r\ncattle, she was not alarmed at her situation, but took advantage of\r\nevery opportunity to urge her horse on in the hopes of pushing her way\r\nthrough the cavalcade. Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures,\r\neither by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of\r\nthe mustang, and excited it to madness. In an instant it reared up upon\r\nits hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that\r\nwould have unseated any but a most skilful rider. The situation was full\r\nof peril. Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns\r\nagain, and goaded it to fresh madness. It was all that the girl could\r\ndo to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death\r\nunder the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals. Unaccustomed to\r\nsudden emergencies, her head began to swim, and her grip upon the bridle\r\nto relax. Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the\r\nstruggling creatures, she might have abandoned her efforts in despair,\r\nbut for a kindly voice at her elbow which assured her of assistance. At\r\nthe same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by\r\nthe curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her to the\r\noutskirts.\r\n\r\n\"You're not hurt, I hope, miss,\" said her preserver, respectfully.\r\n\r\nShe looked up at his dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily. \"I'm awful\r\nfrightened,\" she said, naively; \"whoever would have thought that Poncho\r\nwould have been so scared by a lot of cows?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God you kept your seat,\" the other said earnestly. He was a tall,\r\nsavage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and\r\nclad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his\r\nshoulders. \"I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,\" he remarked,\r\n\"I saw you ride down from his house. When you see him, ask him if he\r\nremembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he's the same Ferrier, my\r\nfather and he were pretty thick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't you better come and ask yourself?\" she asked, demurely.\r\n\r\nThe young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his dark eyes\r\nsparkled with pleasure. \"I'll do so,\" he said, \"we've been in the\r\nmountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting\r\ncondition. He must take us as he finds us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,\" she answered,\r\n\"he's awful fond of me. If those cows had jumped on me he'd have never\r\ngot over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither would I,\" said her companion.\r\n\r\n\"You! Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow.\r\nYou ain't even a friend of ours.\"\r\n\r\nThe young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy\r\nFerrier laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"There, I didn't mean that,\" she said; \"of course, you are a friend now.\r\nYou must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won't trust\r\nme with his business any more. Good-bye!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye,\" he answered, raising his broad sombrero, and bending over\r\nher little hand. She wheeled her mustang round, gave it a cut with her\r\nriding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nYoung Jefferson Hope rode on with his companions, gloomy and taciturn.\r\nHe and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver,\r\nand were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital\r\nenough to work some lodes which they had discovered. He had been as keen\r\nas any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn\r\nhis thoughts into another channel. The sight of the fair young girl,\r\nas frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his volcanic,\r\nuntamed heart to its very depths. When she had vanished from his sight,\r\nhe realized that a crisis had come in his life, and that neither silver\r\nspeculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to\r\nhim as this new and all-absorbing one. The love which had sprung up in\r\nhis heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the\r\nwild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper. He\r\nhad been accustomed to succeed in all that he undertook. He swore in\r\nhis heart that he would not fail in this if human effort and human\r\nperseverance could render him successful.\r\n\r\nHe called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until\r\nhis face was a familiar one at the farm-house. John, cooped up in the\r\nvalley, and absorbed in his work, had had little chance of learning\r\nthe news of the outside world during the last twelve years. All this\r\nJefferson Hope was able to tell him, and in a style which interested\r\nLucy as well as her father. He had been a pioneer in California, and\r\ncould narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost\r\nin those wild, halcyon days. He had been a scout too, and a trapper, a\r\nsilver explorer, and a ranchman. Wherever stirring adventures were to be\r\nhad, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He soon became a\r\nfavourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his virtues. On\r\nsuch occasions, Lucy was silent, but her blushing cheek and her bright,\r\nhappy eyes, showed only too clearly that her young heart was no longer\r\nher own. Her honest father may not have observed these symptoms,\r\nbut they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nIt was a summer evening when he came galloping down the road and pulled\r\nup at the gate. She was at the doorway, and came down to meet him. He\r\nthrew the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway.\r\n\r\n\"I am off, Lucy,\" he said, taking her two hands in his, and gazing\r\ntenderly down into her face; \"I won't ask you to come with me now, but\r\nwill you be ready to come when I am here again?\"\r\n\r\n\"And when will that be?\" she asked, blushing and laughing.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my\r\ndarling. There's no one who can stand between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how about father?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"He has given his consent, provided we get these mines working all\r\nright. I have no fear on that head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's\r\nno more to be said,\" she whispered, with her cheek against his broad\r\nbreast.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" he said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her. \"It is\r\nsettled, then. The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are\r\nwaiting for me at the canon. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye. In two\r\nmonths you shall see me.\"\r\n\r\nHe tore himself from her as he spoke, and, flinging himself upon his\r\nhorse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though\r\nafraid that his resolution might fail him if he took one glance at\r\nwhat he was leaving. She stood at the gate, gazing after him until\r\nhe vanished from her sight. Then she walked back into the house, the\r\nhappiest girl in all Utah.\r\n\nTHREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had\r\ndeparted from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier's heart was sore within him\r\nwhen he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending loss of\r\nhis adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled him to\r\nthe arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had always\r\ndetermined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing would ever\r\ninduce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a marriage he\r\nregarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever\r\nhe might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he was\r\ninflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject, however, for to\r\nexpress an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in\r\nthe Land of the Saints.\r\n\r\nYes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared\r\nonly whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something\r\nwhich fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a\r\nswift retribution upon them. The victims of persecution had now turned\r\npersecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most\r\nterrible description. Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German\r\nVehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put\r\na more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over\r\nthe State of Utah.\r\n\r\nIts invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made\r\nthis organization doubly terrible. It appeared to be omniscient and\r\nomnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. The man who held out\r\nagainst the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he had gone or\r\nwhat had befallen him. His wife and his children awaited him at home,\r\nbut no father ever returned to tell them how he had fared at the\r\nhands of his secret judges. A rash word or a hasty act was followed\r\nby annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this\r\nterrible power which was suspended over them. No wonder that men\r\nwent about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the\r\nwilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.\r\n\r\nAt first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the\r\nrecalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards\r\nto pervert or to abandon it. Soon, however, it took a wider range. The\r\nsupply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female\r\npopulation on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed. Strange\r\nrumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and\r\nrifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen. Fresh women\r\nappeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and\r\nbore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror. Belated\r\nwanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked,\r\nstealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness. These\r\ntales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and\r\nre-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.\r\nTo this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite\r\nBand, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.\r\n\r\nFuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible\r\nresults served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it\r\ninspired in the minds of men. None knew who belonged to this ruthless\r\nsociety. The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and\r\nviolence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.\r\nThe very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the\r\nProphet and his mission, might be one of those who would come forth at\r\nnight with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation. Hence every\r\nman feared his neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were\r\nnearest his heart.\r\n\r\nOne fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his wheatfields,\r\nwhen he heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window,\r\nsaw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway. His\r\nheart leapt to his mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham\r\nYoung himself. Full of trepidation--for he knew that such a visit boded\r\nhim little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief. The\r\nlatter, however, received his salutations coldly, and followed him with\r\na stern face into the sitting-room.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Ferrier,\" he said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly\r\nfrom under his light-coloured eyelashes, \"the true believers have been\r\ngood friends to you. We picked you up when you were starving in the\r\ndesert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley,\r\ngave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our\r\nprotection. Is not this so?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so,\" answered John Ferrier.\r\n\r\n\"In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you\r\nshould embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.\r\nThis you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have\r\nneglected.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how have I neglected it?\" asked Ferrier, throwing out his hands in\r\nexpostulation. \"Have I not given to the common fund? Have I not attended\r\nat the Temple? Have I not----?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are your wives?\" asked Young, looking round him. \"Call them in,\r\nthat I may greet them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that I have not married,\" Ferrier answered. \"But women\r\nwere few, and there were many who had better claims than I. I was not a\r\nlonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,\" said the leader\r\nof the Mormons. \"She has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found\r\nfavour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier groaned internally.\r\n\r\n\"There are stories of her which I would fain disbelieve--stories that\r\nshe is sealed to some Gentile. This must be the gossip of idle tongues.\r\nWhat is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith?\r\n'Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if\r\nshe wed a Gentile, she commits a grievous sin.' This being so, it is\r\nimpossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your\r\ndaughter to violate it.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier made no answer, but he played nervously with his\r\nriding-whip.\r\n\r\n\"Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been\r\ndecided in the Sacred Council of Four. The girl is young, and we would\r\nnot have her wed grey hairs, neither would we deprive her of all\r\nchoice. We Elders have many heifers, [29] but our children must also\r\nbe provided. Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of\r\nthem would gladly welcome your daughter to their house. Let her choose\r\nbetween them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith. What say\r\nyou to that?\"\r\n\r\nFerrier remained silent for some little time with his brows knitted.\r\n\r\n\"You will give us time,\" he said at last. \"My daughter is very\r\nyoung--she is scarce of an age to marry.\"\r\n\r\n\"She shall have a month to choose,\" said Young, rising from his seat.\r\n\"At the end of that time she shall give her answer.\"\r\n\r\nHe was passing through the door, when he turned, with flushed face and\r\nflashing eyes. \"It were better for you, John Ferrier,\" he thundered,\r\n\"that you and she were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra\r\nBlanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of\r\nthe Holy Four!\"\r\n\r\nWith a threatening gesture of his hand, he turned from the door, and\r\nFerrier heard his heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting with his elbows upon his knees, considering how he\r\nshould broach the matter to his daughter when a soft hand was laid upon\r\nhis, and looking up, he saw her standing beside him. One glance at her\r\npale, frightened face showed him that she had heard what had passed.\r\n\r\n\"I could not help it,\" she said, in answer to his look. \"His voice rang\r\nthrough the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you scare yourself,\" he answered, drawing her to him, and passing\r\nhis broad, rough hand caressingly over her chestnut hair. \"We'll fix it\r\nup somehow or another. You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for\r\nthis chap, do you?\"\r\n\r\nA sob and a squeeze of his hand was her only answer.\r\n\r\n\"No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. He's a\r\nlikely lad, and he's a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in\r\nspite o' all their praying and preaching. There's a party starting for\r\nNevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him a message letting him know\r\nthe hole we are in. If I know anything o' that young man, he'll be back\r\nhere with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.\"\r\n\r\nLucy laughed through her tears at her father's description.\r\n\r\n\"When he comes, he will advise us for the best. But it is for you that\r\nI am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about\r\nthose who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we haven't opposed him yet,\" her father answered. \"It will be time\r\nto look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before us; at\r\nthe end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave Utah!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's about the size of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go. To tell\r\nthe truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. I\r\ndon't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their\r\ndarned prophet. I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to me. Guess\r\nI'm too old to learn. If he comes browsing about this farm, he might\r\nchance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they won't let us leave,\" his daughter objected.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. In the meantime,\r\ndon't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes swelled up,\r\nelse he'll be walking into me when he sees you. There's nothing to be\r\nafeared about, and there's no danger at all.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone,\r\nbut she could not help observing that he paid unusual care to the\r\nfastening of the doors that night, and that he carefully cleaned and\r\nloaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his bedroom.\r\n\nON the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,\r\nJohn Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his\r\nacquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he entrusted him\r\nwith his message to Jefferson Hope. In it he told the young man of the\r\nimminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he\r\nshould return. Having done thus he felt easier in his mind, and returned\r\nhome with a lighter heart.\r\n\r\nAs he approached his farm, he was surprised to see a horse hitched to\r\neach of the posts of the gate. Still more surprised was he on entering\r\nto find two young men in possession of his sitting-room. One, with a\r\nlong pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his feet\r\ncocked up upon the stove. The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse\r\nbloated features, was standing in front of the window with his hands in\r\nhis pocket, whistling a popular hymn. Both of them nodded to Ferrier as\r\nhe entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you don't know us,\" he said. \"This here is the son of Elder\r\nDrebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert\r\nwhen the Lord stretched out His hand and gathered you into the true\r\nfold.\"\r\n\r\n\"As He will all the nations in His own good time,\" said the other in a\r\nnasal voice; \"He grindeth slowly but exceeding small.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier bowed coldly. He had guessed who his visitors were.\r\n\r\n\"We have come,\" continued Stangerson, \"at the advice of our fathers to\r\nsolicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to\r\nyou and to her. As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has\r\nseven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,\" cried the other; \"the question is not\r\nhow many wives we have, but how many we can keep. My father has now\r\ngiven over his mills to me, and I am the richer man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my prospects are better,\" said the other, warmly. \"When the\r\nLord removes my father, I shall have his tanning yard and his leather\r\nfactory. Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be for the maiden to decide,\" rejoined young Drebber, smirking\r\nat his own reflection in the glass. \"We will leave it all to her\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway,\r\nhardly able to keep his riding-whip from the backs of his two visitors.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" he said at last, striding up to them, \"when my daughter\r\nsummons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your faces\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThe two young Mormons stared at him in amazement. In their eyes this\r\ncompetition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of\r\nhonours both to her and her father.\r\n\r\n\"There are two ways out of the room,\" cried Ferrier; \"there is the door,\r\nand there is the window. Which do you care to use?\"\r\n\r\nHis brown face looked so savage, and his gaunt hands so threatening,\r\nthat his visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat. The\r\nold farmer followed them to the door.\r\n\r\n\"Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,\" he said,\r\nsardonically.\r\n\r\n\"You shall smart for this!\" Stangerson cried, white with rage. \"You have\r\ndefied the Prophet and the Council of Four. You shall rue it to the end\r\nof your days.\"\r\n\r\n\"The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,\" cried young Drebber; \"He\r\nwill arise and smite you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll start the smiting,\" exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would\r\nhave rushed upstairs for his gun had not Lucy seized him by the arm and\r\nrestrained him. Before he could escape from her, the clatter of horses'\r\nhoofs told him that they were beyond his reach.\r\n\r\n\"The young canting rascals!\" he exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from\r\nhis forehead; \"I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the\r\nwife of either of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so should I, father,\" she answered, with spirit; \"but Jefferson\r\nwill soon be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It will not be long before he comes. The sooner the better, for we\r\ndo not know what their next move may be.\"\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and\r\nhelp should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his adopted\r\ndaughter. In the whole history of the settlement there had never been\r\nsuch a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders. If\r\nminor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this\r\narch rebel. Ferrier knew that his wealth and position would be of no\r\navail to him. Others as well known and as rich as himself had been\r\nspirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church. He\r\nwas a brave man, but he trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which\r\nhung over him. Any known danger he could face with a firm lip, but\r\nthis suspense was unnerving. He concealed his fears from his daughter,\r\nhowever, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she,\r\nwith the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at ease.\r\n\r\nHe expected that he would receive some message or remonstrance from\r\nYoung as to his conduct, and he was not mistaken, though it came in an\r\nunlooked-for manner. Upon rising next morning he found, to his surprise,\r\na small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his bed just over\r\nhis chest. On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:--\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then----\"\r\n\r\nThe dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been. How\r\nthis warning came into his room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his\r\nservants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been\r\nsecured. He crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his daughter, but\r\nthe incident struck a chill into his heart. The twenty-nine days were\r\nevidently the balance of the month which Young had promised. What\r\nstrength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such\r\nmysterious powers? The hand which fastened that pin might have struck\r\nhim to the heart, and he could never have known who had slain him.\r\n\r\nStill more shaken was he next morning. They had sat down to their\r\nbreakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the\r\ncentre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently,\r\nthe number 28. To his daughter it was unintelligible, and he did not\r\nenlighten her. That night he sat up with his gun and kept watch and\r\nward. He saw and he heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had\r\nbeen painted upon the outside of his door.\r\n\r\nThus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he found that his\r\nunseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some\r\nconspicuous position how many days were still left to him out of the\r\nmonth of grace. Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls,\r\nsometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards\r\nstuck upon the garden gate or the railings. With all his vigilance John\r\nFerrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A\r\nhorror which was almost superstitious came upon him at the sight of\r\nthem. He became haggard and restless, and his eyes had the troubled look\r\nof some hunted creature. He had but one hope in life now, and that was\r\nfor the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada.\r\n\r\nTwenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news\r\nof the absentee. One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there\r\ncame no sign of him. Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a\r\ndriver shouted at his team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking\r\nthat help had arrived at last. At last, when he saw five give way to\r\nfour and that again to three, he lost heart, and abandoned all hope of\r\nescape. Single-handed, and with his limited knowledge of the mountains\r\nwhich surrounded the settlement, he knew that he was powerless. The\r\nmore-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could\r\npass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he\r\nwould, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him.\r\nYet the old man never wavered in his resolution to part with life itself\r\nbefore he consented to what he regarded as his daughter's dishonour.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his troubles, and\r\nsearching vainly for some way out of them. That morning had shown the\r\nfigure 2 upon the wall of his house, and the next day would be the last\r\nof the allotted time. What was to happen then? All manner of vague and\r\nterrible fancies filled his imagination. And his daughter--what was to\r\nbecome of her after he was gone? Was there no escape from the invisible\r\nnetwork which was drawn all round them. He sank his head upon the table\r\nand sobbed at the thought of his own impotence.\r\n\r\nWhat was that? In the silence he heard a gentle scratching sound--low,\r\nbut very distinct in the quiet of the night. It came from the door of\r\nthe house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There\r\nwas a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was\r\nrepeated. Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the\r\npanels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry\r\nout the murderous orders of the secret tribunal? Or was it some agent\r\nwho was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier\r\nfelt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook\r\nhis nerves and chilled his heart. Springing forward he drew the bolt and\r\nthrew the door open.\r\n\r\nOutside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were\r\ntwinkling brightly overhead. The little front garden lay before the\r\nfarmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on\r\nthe road was any human being to be seen. With a sigh of relief, Ferrier\r\nlooked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at\r\nhis own feet he saw to his astonishment a man lying flat upon his face\r\nupon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.\r\n\r\nSo unnerved was he at the sight that he leaned up against the wall with\r\nhis hand to his throat to stifle his inclination to call out. His first\r\nthought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying\r\nman, but as he watched it he saw it writhe along the ground and into the\r\nhall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent. Once within the\r\nhouse the man sprang to his feet, closed the door, and revealed to the\r\nastonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson\r\nHope.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" gasped John Ferrier. \"How you scared me! Whatever made you\r\ncome in like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me food,\" the other said, hoarsely. \"I have had no time for bite\r\nor sup for eight-and-forty hours.\" He flung himself upon the [21] cold\r\nmeat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his host's\r\nsupper, and devoured it voraciously. \"Does Lucy bear up well?\" he asked,\r\nwhen he had satisfied his hunger.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. She does not know the danger,\" her father answered.\r\n\r\n\"That is well. The house is watched on every side. That is why I crawled\r\nmy way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp\r\nenough to catch a Washoe hunter.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Ferrier felt a different man now that he realized that he had\r\na devoted ally. He seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it\r\ncordially. \"You're a man to be proud of,\" he said. \"There are not many\r\nwho would come to share our danger and our troubles.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've hit it there, pard,\" the young hunter answered. \"I have a\r\nrespect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice\r\nbefore I put my head into such a hornet's nest. It's Lucy that brings me\r\nhere, and before harm comes on her I guess there will be one less o' the\r\nHope family in Utah.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.\r\nI have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money\r\nhave you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson\r\nCity through the mountains. You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that\r\nthe servants do not sleep in the house.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Ferrier was absent, preparing his daughter for the approaching\r\njourney, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he could find into\r\na small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he knew by\r\nexperience that the mountain wells were few and far between. He had\r\nhardly completed his arrangements before the farmer returned with his\r\ndaughter all dressed and ready for a start. The greeting between the\r\nlovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was\r\nmuch to be done.\r\n\r\n\"We must make our start at once,\" said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low\r\nbut resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril,\r\nbut has steeled his heart to meet it. \"The front and back entrances are\r\nwatched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and\r\nacross the fields. Once on the road we are only two miles from the\r\nRavine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way\r\nthrough the mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"What if we are stopped,\" asked Ferrier.\r\n\r\nHope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his\r\ntunic. \"If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them\r\nwith us,\" he said with a sinister smile.\r\n\r\nThe lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the\r\ndarkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his own,\r\nand which he was now about to abandon for ever. He had long nerved\r\nhimself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and\r\nhappiness of his daughter outweighed any regret at his ruined fortunes.\r\nAll looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad\r\nsilent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that\r\nthe spirit of murder lurked through it all. Yet the white face and set\r\nexpression of the young hunter showed that in his approach to the house\r\nhe had seen enough to satisfy him upon that head.\r\n\r\nFerrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty\r\nprovisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few\r\nof her more valued possessions. Opening the window very slowly and\r\ncarefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the\r\nnight, and then one by one passed through into the little garden. With\r\nbated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained\r\nthe shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap\r\nwhich opened into the cornfields. They had just reached this point when\r\nthe young man seized his two companions and dragged them down into the\r\nshadow, where they lay silent and trembling.\r\n\r\nIt was as well that his prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the\r\nears of a lynx. He and his friends had hardly crouched down before the\r\nmelancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards\r\nof them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small\r\ndistance. At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the\r\ngap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry\r\nagain, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow at midnight,\" said the first who appeared to be in authority.\r\n\"When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well,\" returned the other. \"Shall I tell Brother Drebber?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pass it on to him, and from him to the others. Nine to seven!\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven to five!\" repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away\r\nin different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some\r\nform of sign and countersign. The instant that their footsteps had died\r\naway in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his feet, and helping his\r\ncompanions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top\r\nof his speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her strength\r\nappeared to fail her.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry on! hurry on!\" he gasped from time to time. \"We are through the\r\nline of sentinels. Everything depends on speed. Hurry on!\"\r\n\r\nOnce on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they\r\nmeet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid\r\nrecognition. Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a\r\nrugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. Two dark jagged\r\npeaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led\r\nbetween them was the Eagle Canon in which the horses were awaiting them.\r\nWith unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his way among the great\r\nboulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he came to\r\nthe retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had\r\nbeen picketed. The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon\r\none of the horses, with his money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the\r\nother along the precipitous and dangerous path.\r\n\r\nIt was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face\r\nNature in her wildest moods. On the one side a great crag towered up a\r\nthousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic\r\ncolumns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.\r\nOn the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance\r\nimpossible. Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places\r\nthat they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised\r\nriders could have traversed it at all. Yet in spite of all dangers and\r\ndifficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them,\r\nfor every step increased the distance between them and the terrible\r\ndespotism from which they were flying.\r\n\r\nThey soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the\r\njurisdiction of the Saints. They had reached the very wildest and most\r\ndesolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and\r\npointed upwards. On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark\r\nand plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He saw them\r\nas soon as they perceived him, and his military challenge of \"Who goes\r\nthere?\" rang through the silent ravine.\r\n\r\n\"Travellers for Nevada,\" said Jefferson Hope, with his hand upon the\r\nrifle which hung by his saddle.\r\n\r\nThey could see the lonely watcher fingering his gun, and peering down at\r\nthem as if dissatisfied at their reply.\r\n\r\n\"By whose permission?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The Holy Four,\" answered Ferrier. His Mormon experiences had taught him\r\nthat that was the highest authority to which he could refer.\r\n\r\n\"Nine from seven,\" cried the sentinel.\r\n\r\n\"Seven from five,\" returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the\r\ncountersign which he had heard in the garden.\r\n\r\n\"Pass, and the Lord go with you,\" said the voice from above. Beyond his\r\npost the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a\r\ntrot. Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon\r\nhis gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen\r\npeople, and that freedom lay before them.\r\n\nALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular\r\nand rock-strewn paths. More than once they lost their way, but Hope's\r\nintimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track\r\nonce more. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage\r\nbeauty lay before them. In every direction the great snow-capped peaks\r\nhemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon.\r\nSo steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch\r\nand the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a\r\ngust of wind to come hurtling down upon them. Nor was the fear entirely\r\nan illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and\r\nboulders which had fallen in a similar manner. Even as they passed,\r\na great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke\r\nthe echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nAs the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great\r\nmountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until\r\nthey were all ruddy and glowing. The magnificent spectacle cheered the\r\nhearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy. At a wild\r\ntorrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their\r\nhorses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast. Lucy and her father\r\nwould fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. \"They\r\nwill be upon our track by this time,\" he said. \"Everything depends upon\r\nour speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our\r\nlives.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and\r\nby evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from\r\ntheir enemies. At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag,\r\nwhere the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there\r\nhuddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep. Before\r\ndaybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more. They had\r\nseen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that\r\nthey were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose\r\nenmity they had incurred. He little knew how far that iron grasp could\r\nreach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store\r\nof provisions began to run out. This gave the hunter little uneasiness,\r\nhowever, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he had\r\nfrequently before had to depend upon his rifle for the needs of life.\r\nChoosing a sheltered nook, he piled together a few dried branches and\r\nmade a blazing fire, at which his companions might warm themselves, for\r\nthey were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air\r\nwas bitter and keen. Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu,\r\nhe threw his gun over his shoulder, and set out in search of whatever\r\nchance might throw in his way. Looking back he saw the old man and the\r\nyoung girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals\r\nstood motionless in the back-ground. Then the intervening rocks hid them\r\nfrom his view.\r\n\r\nHe walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without\r\nsuccess, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other\r\nindications, he judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.\r\nAt last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he was thinking of\r\nturning back in despair, when casting his eyes upwards he saw a sight\r\nwhich sent a thrill of pleasure through his heart. On the edge of a\r\njutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him, there stood a\r\ncreature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a\r\npair of gigantic horns. The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting,\r\nprobably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter;\r\nbut fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not\r\nperceived him. Lying on his face, he rested his rifle upon a rock, and\r\ntook a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger. The animal sprang\r\ninto the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and\r\nthen came crashing down into the valley beneath.\r\n\r\nThe creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself\r\nwith cutting away one haunch and part of the flank. With this trophy\r\nover his shoulder, he hastened to retrace his steps, for the evening was\r\nalready drawing in. He had hardly started, however, before he realized\r\nthe difficulty which faced him. In his eagerness he had wandered far\r\npast the ravines which were known to him, and it was no easy matter\r\nto pick out the path which he had taken. The valley in which he found\r\nhimself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like\r\neach other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.\r\nHe followed one for a mile or more until he came to a mountain torrent\r\nwhich he was sure that he had never seen before. Convinced that he had\r\ntaken the wrong turn, he tried another, but with the same result. Night\r\nwas coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he at last found\r\nhimself in a defile which was familiar to him. Even then it was no easy\r\nmatter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and\r\nthe high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound. Weighed\r\ndown with his burden, and weary from his exertions, he stumbled along,\r\nkeeping up his heart by the reflection that every step brought him\r\nnearer to Lucy, and that he carried with him enough to ensure them food\r\nfor the remainder of their journey.\r\n\r\nHe had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he had left\r\nthem. Even in the darkness he could recognize the outline of the cliffs\r\nwhich bounded it. They must, he reflected, be awaiting him anxiously,\r\nfor he had been absent nearly five hours. In the gladness of his heart\r\nhe put his hands to his mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo\r\nas a signal that he was coming. He paused and listened for an answer.\r\nNone came save his own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent\r\nravines, and was borne back to his ears in countless repetitions. Again\r\nhe shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from\r\nthe friends whom he had left such a short time ago. A vague, nameless\r\ndread came over him, and he hurried onwards frantically, dropping the\r\nprecious food in his agitation.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned the corner, he came full in sight of the spot where the\r\nfire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there,\r\nbut it had evidently not been tended since his departure. The same\r\ndead silence still reigned all round. With his fears all changed to\r\nconvictions, he hurried on. There was no living creature near the\r\nremains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone. It was only\r\ntoo clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during\r\nhis absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no\r\ntraces behind it.\r\n\r\nBewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his head spin\r\nround, and had to lean upon his rifle to save himself from falling. He\r\nwas essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from\r\nhis temporary impotence. Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the\r\nsmouldering fire, he blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help\r\nto examine the little camp. The ground was all stamped down by the feet\r\nof horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken\r\nthe fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had\r\nafterwards turned back to Salt Lake City. Had they carried back both of\r\nhis companions with them? Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself\r\nthat they must have done so, when his eye fell upon an object which made\r\nevery nerve of his body tingle within him. A little way on one side of\r\nthe camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly\r\nnot been there before. There was no mistaking it for anything but a\r\nnewly-dug grave. As the young hunter approached it, he perceived that a\r\nstick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft\r\nfork of it. The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point:\r\n\r\n                        JOHN FERRIER,\r\n                 FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, [22]\r\n                    Died August 4th, 1860.\r\n\r\nThe sturdy old man, whom he had left so short a time before, was gone,\r\nthen, and this was all his epitaph. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round\r\nto see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one. Lucy\r\nhad been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her original\r\ndestiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder's son. As the young\r\nfellow realized the certainty of her fate, and his own powerlessness to\r\nprevent it, he wished that he, too, was lying with the old farmer in his\r\nlast silent resting-place.\r\n\r\nAgain, however, his active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs\r\nfrom despair. If there was nothing else left to him, he could at least\r\ndevote his life to revenge. With indomitable patience and perseverance,\r\nJefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which\r\nhe may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he had lived. As he\r\nstood by the desolate fire, he felt that the only one thing which could\r\nassuage his grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought\r\nby his own hand upon his enemies. His strong will and untiring energy\r\nshould, he determined, be devoted to that one end. With a grim, white\r\nface, he retraced his steps to where he had dropped the food, and having\r\nstirred up the smouldering fire, he cooked enough to last him for a\r\nfew days. This he made up into a bundle, and, tired as he was, he\r\nset himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the\r\navenging angels.\r\n\r\nFor five days he toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he\r\nhad already traversed on horseback. At night he flung himself down among\r\nthe rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he was\r\nalways well on his way. On the sixth day, he reached the Eagle Canon,\r\nfrom which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he could\r\nlook down upon the home of the saints. Worn and exhausted, he leaned\r\nupon his rifle and shook his gaunt hand fiercely at the silent\r\nwidespread city beneath him. As he looked at it, he observed that\r\nthere were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of\r\nfestivity. He was still speculating as to what this might mean when he\r\nheard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards\r\nhim. As he approached, he recognized him as a Mormon named Cowper, to\r\nwhom he had rendered services at different times. He therefore accosted\r\nhim when he got up to him, with the object of finding out what Lucy\r\nFerrier's fate had been.\r\n\r\n\"I am Jefferson Hope,\" he said. \"You remember me.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mormon looked at him with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was\r\ndifficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly\r\nwhite face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former\r\ndays. Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his identity,\r\nthe man's surprise changed to consternation.\r\n\r\n\"You are mad to come here,\" he cried. \"It is as much as my own life is\r\nworth to be seen talking with you. There is a warrant against you from\r\nthe Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't fear them, or their warrant,\" Hope said, earnestly. \"You must\r\nknow something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you\r\nhold dear to answer a few questions. We have always been friends. For\r\nGod's sake, don't refuse to answer me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" the Mormon asked uneasily. \"Be quick. The very rocks have\r\nears and the trees eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has become of Lucy Ferrier?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up, you\r\nhave no life left in you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't mind me,\" said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips, and\r\nhad sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning. \"Married,\r\nyou say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment\r\nHouse. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson\r\nas to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party that followed\r\nthem, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed to give him the\r\nbest claim; but when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was\r\nthe stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to him. No one won't have\r\nher very long though, for I saw death in her face yesterday. She is more\r\nlike a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am off,\" said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat. His\r\nface might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its\r\nexpression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his shoulder,\r\nstrode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to\r\nthe haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there was none so fierce\r\nand so dangerous as himself.\r\n\r\nThe prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it was\r\nthe terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful marriage\r\ninto which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her head again,\r\nbut pined away and died within a month. Her sottish husband, who had\r\nmarried her principally for the sake of John Ferrier's property, did not\r\naffect any great grief at his bereavement; but his other wives mourned\r\nover her, and sat up with her the night before the burial, as is the\r\nMormon custom. They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of\r\nthe morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment,\r\nthe door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in\r\ntattered garments strode into the room. Without a glance or a word to\r\nthe cowering women, he walked up to the white silent figure which had\r\nonce contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he\r\npressed his lips reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching\r\nup her hand, he took the wedding-ring from her finger. \"She shall not be\r\nburied in that,\" he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could\r\nbe raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief\r\nwas the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe\r\nit themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the\r\nundeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as having been\r\na bride had disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading\r\na strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for\r\nvengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the weird\r\nfigure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted\r\nthe lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's\r\nwindow and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him. On\r\nanother occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder\r\ncrashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by throwing\r\nhimself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long in\r\ndiscovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led\r\nrepeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or\r\nkilling their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted the\r\nprecaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having\r\ntheir houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax these\r\nmeasures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and\r\nthey hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.\r\n\r\nFar from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's mind\r\nwas of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge\r\nhad taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for\r\nany other emotion. He was, however, above all things practical. He soon\r\nrealized that even his iron constitution could not stand the incessant\r\nstrain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and want of wholesome food\r\nwere wearing him out. If he died like a dog among the mountains, what\r\nwas to become of his revenge then? And yet such a death was sure to\r\novertake him if he persisted. He felt that that was to play his enemy's\r\ngame, so he reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to\r\nrecruit his health and to amass money enough to allow him to pursue his\r\nobject without privation.\r\n\r\nHis intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a\r\ncombination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the mines\r\nfor nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory of\r\nhis wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that\r\nmemorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave. Disguised,\r\nand under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City, careless\r\nwhat became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he knew to\r\nbe justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There had been a\r\nschism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger\r\nmembers of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the\r\nElders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the\r\nmalcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles. Among these had been\r\nDrebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone. Rumour\r\nreported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his\r\nproperty into money, and that he had departed a wealthy man, while his\r\ncompanion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor. There was no clue at all,\r\nhowever, as to their whereabouts.\r\n\r\nMany a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of\r\nrevenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never\r\nfaltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked out\r\nby such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to town\r\nthrough the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed into\r\nyear, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on, a human\r\nbloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he\r\nhad devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded. It was\r\nbut a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him that\r\nCleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit of. He\r\nreturned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance all\r\narranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his window,\r\nhad recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in\r\nhis eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by\r\nStangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to him\r\nthat they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of\r\nan old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and\r\nnot being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. When at\r\nlast he was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber's house was\r\ndeserted, and that he and his secretary had departed for Europe.\r\n\r\nAgain the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred\r\nurged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and\r\nfor some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his\r\napproaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in\r\nhim, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to\r\ncity, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the\r\nfugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris;\r\nand when he followed them there he learned that they had just set off\r\nfor Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days late, for\r\nthey had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded in running\r\nthem to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote\r\nthe old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson's Journal,\r\nto which we are already under such obligations.\r\n\nOUR prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any\r\nferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself\r\npowerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes that\r\nhe had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. \"I guess you're going to take\r\nme to the police-station,\" he remarked to Sherlock Holmes. \"My cab's at\r\nthe door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it. I'm not so light\r\nto lift as I used to be.\"\r\n\r\nGregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this\r\nproposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at\r\nhis word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his ancles.\r\n[23] He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself that\r\nthey were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed\r\nhim, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his dark\r\nsunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was\r\nas formidable as his personal strength.\r\n\r\n\"If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you\r\nare the man for it,\" he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my\r\nfellow-lodger. \"The way you kept on my trail was a caution.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better come with me,\" said Holmes to the two detectives.\r\n\r\n\"I can drive you,\" said Lestrade.\r\n\r\n\"Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have\r\ntaken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.\"\r\n\r\nI assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made no\r\nattempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his,\r\nand we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and\r\nbrought us in a very short time to our destination. We were ushered into\r\na small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner's name\r\nand the names of the men with whose murder he had been charged. The\r\nofficial was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his\r\nduties in a dull mechanical way. \"The prisoner will be put before the\r\nmagistrates in the course of the week,\" he said; \"in the mean time, Mr.\r\nJefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say? I must warn you\r\nthat your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've got a good deal to say,\" our prisoner said slowly. \"I want to tell\r\nyou gentlemen all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?\" asked the Inspector.\r\n\r\n\"I may never be tried,\" he answered. \"You needn't look startled. It\r\nisn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?\" He turned his fierce\r\ndark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I am,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then put your hand here,\" he said, with a smile, motioning with his\r\nmanacled wrists towards his chest.\r\n\r\nI did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and\r\ncommotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest seemed to\r\nthrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful\r\nengine was at work. In the silence of the room I could hear a dull\r\nhumming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" I cried, \"you have an aortic aneurism!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what they call it,\" he said, placidly. \"I went to a Doctor last\r\nweek about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before many days\r\npassed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure\r\nand under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've done my work now,\r\nand I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account\r\nof the business behind me. I don't want to be remembered as a common\r\ncut-throat.\"\r\n\r\nThe Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the\r\nadvisability of allowing him to tell his story.\r\n\r\n\"Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?\" the former\r\nasked, [24]\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly there is,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to\r\ntake his statement,\" said the Inspector. \"You are at liberty, sir, to\r\ngive your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll sit down, with your leave,\" the prisoner said, suiting the action\r\nto the word. \"This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the\r\ntussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the brink\r\nof the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I say is the\r\nabsolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began\r\nthe following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical\r\nmanner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace enough.\r\nI can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had\r\naccess to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's words were taken\r\ndown exactly as they were uttered.\r\n\r\n\"It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,\" he said; \"it's\r\nenough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a father\r\nand a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own\r\nlives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was\r\nimpossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court. I\r\nknew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge,\r\njury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done the same, if\r\nyou have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.\r\n\r\n\"That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She\r\nwas forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart over\r\nit. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed that his\r\ndying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his last thoughts\r\nshould be of the crime for which he was punished. I have carried\r\nit about with me, and have followed him and his accomplice over two\r\ncontinents until I caught them. They thought to tire me out, but they\r\ncould not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing\r\nthat my work in this world is done, and well done. They have perished,\r\nand by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.\r\n\r\n\"They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to\r\nfollow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found\r\nthat I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving and riding\r\nare as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner's office,\r\nand soon got employment. I was to bring a certain sum a week to the\r\nowner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself. There was\r\nseldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow. The hardest job\r\nwas to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever\r\nwere contrived, this city is the most confusing. I had a map beside me\r\nthough, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I\r\ngot on pretty well.\r\n\r\n\"It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living;\r\nbut I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them. They\r\nwere at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the\r\nriver. When once I found them out I knew that I had them at my mercy. I\r\nhad grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.\r\nI would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was\r\ndetermined that they should not escape me again.\r\n\r\n\"They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about\r\nLondon, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my\r\ncab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they\r\ncould not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or late\r\nat night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand\r\nwith my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay\r\nmy hand upon the men I wanted.\r\n\r\n\"They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there was\r\nsome chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone,\r\nand never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind them every\r\nday, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half\r\nthe time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I watched them\r\nlate and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not\r\ndiscouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come. My\r\nonly fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon\r\nand leave my work undone.\r\n\r\n\"At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the\r\nstreet was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to\r\ntheir door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time\r\nDrebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up my horse\r\nand kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared\r\nthat they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston Station they\r\ngot out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the\r\nplatform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer\r\nthat one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours.\r\nStangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased\r\nthan otherwise. I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear\r\nevery word that passed between them. Drebber said that he had a little\r\nbusiness of his own to do, and that if the other would wait for him he\r\nwould soon rejoin him. His companion remonstrated with him, and reminded\r\nhim that they had resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the\r\nmatter was a delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch\r\nwhat Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and\r\nreminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that he\r\nmust not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it up\r\nas a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the last\r\ntrain he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber\r\nanswered that he would be back on the platform before eleven, and made\r\nhis way out of the station.\r\n\r\n\"The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my\r\nenemies within my power. Together they could protect each other,\r\nbut singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue\r\nprecipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction in\r\nvengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes\r\nhim, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans arranged by\r\nwhich I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me\r\nunderstand that his old sin had found him out. It chanced that some days\r\nbefore a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in\r\nthe Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage. It\r\nwas claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had\r\ntaken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed. By means of\r\nthis I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could\r\nrely upon being free from interruption. How to get Drebber to that house\r\nwas the difficult problem which I had now to solve.\r\n\r\n\"He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying\r\nfor nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out he\r\nstaggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a\r\nhansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so close\r\nthat the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the whole way.\r\nWe rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until,\r\nto my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he\r\nhad boarded. I could not imagine what his intention was in returning\r\nthere; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from\r\nthe house. He entered it, and his hansom drove away. Give me a glass of\r\nwater, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.\"\r\n\r\nI handed him the glass, and he drank it down.\r\n\r\n\"That's better,\" he said. \"Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or\r\nmore, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the\r\nhouse. Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of\r\nwhom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen\r\nbefore. This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to\r\nthe head of the steps he gave him a shove and a kick which sent him half\r\nacross the road. 'You hound,' he cried, shaking his stick at him; 'I'll\r\nteach you to insult an honest girl!' He was so hot that I think he would\r\nhave thrashed Drebber with his cudgel, only that the cur staggered away\r\ndown the road as fast as his legs would carry him. He ran as far as the\r\ncorner, and then, seeing my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me\r\nto Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that\r\nI feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I drove\r\nalong slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I might\r\ntake him right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane\r\nhave my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this, when he\r\nsolved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him again, and\r\nhe ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in, leaving word\r\nthat I should wait for him. There he remained until closing time, and\r\nwhen he came out he was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would only\r\nhave been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself\r\nto do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for his life\r\nif he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets which I\r\nhave filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and\r\nsweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day the professor was\r\nlecturing on poisions, [25] and he showed his students some alkaloid,\r\nas he called it, which he had extracted from some South American arrow\r\npoison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant\r\ndeath. I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when\r\nthey were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it. I was a fairly\r\ngood dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and\r\neach pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.\r\nI determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should\r\neach have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that\r\nremained. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than\r\nfiring across a handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes\r\nabout with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.\r\n\r\n\"It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard\r\nand raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad within--so\r\nglad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. If any of you\r\ngentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty\r\nlong years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would\r\nunderstand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my\r\nnerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with\r\nexcitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy\r\nlooking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I\r\nsee you all in this room. All the way they were ahead of me, one on each\r\nside of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.\r\n\r\n\"There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the\r\ndripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber\r\nall huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm, 'It's\r\ntime to get out,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'All right, cabby,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,\r\nfor he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.\r\nI had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a little\r\ntop-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him into the\r\nfront room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the\r\ndaughter were walking in front of us.\r\n\r\n\"'It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about.\r\n\r\n\"'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it to\r\na wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I\r\ncontinued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who am\r\nI?'\r\n\r\n\"He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I\r\nsaw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which\r\nshowed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face, and I\r\nsaw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered\r\nin his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed\r\nloud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I\r\nhad never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.\r\n\r\n\"'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.\r\nPetersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your wanderings\r\nhave come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow's sun\r\nrise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his\r\nface that he thought I was mad. So I was for the time. The pulses in my\r\ntemples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit\r\nof some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.\r\n\r\n\"'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door, and\r\nshaking the key in his face. 'Punishment has been slow in coming, but it\r\nhas overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I spoke. He\r\nwould have begged for his life, but he knew well that it was useless.\r\n\r\n\"'Would you murder me?' he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog?\r\nWhat mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from her\r\nslaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and shameless\r\nharem.'\r\n\r\n\"'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.\r\n\r\n\"'But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting\r\nthe box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose and\r\neat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you\r\nleave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled\r\nby chance.'\r\n\r\n\"He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my\r\nknife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I swallowed\r\nthe other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or\r\nmore, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die. Shall I\r\never forget the look which came over his face when the first warning\r\npangs told him that the poison was in his system? I laughed as I saw\r\nit, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his eyes. It was but for\r\na moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid. A spasm of pain\r\ncontorted his features; he threw his hands out in front of him,\r\nstaggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor. I\r\nturned him over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his heart. There\r\nwas no movement. He was dead!\r\n\r\n\"The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of\r\nit. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the\r\nwall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police\r\nupon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I remembered\r\na German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him, and it\r\nwas argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must\r\nhave done it. I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle\r\nthe Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on\r\na convenient place on the wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found\r\nthat there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild. I\r\nhad driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which\r\nI usually kept Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there. I was\r\nthunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her.\r\nThinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's\r\nbody, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly\r\nup to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose\r\nthe ring. When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a\r\npolice-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his\r\nsuspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.\r\n\r\n\"That was how Enoch Drebber came to his end. All I had to do then was\r\nto do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt. I knew\r\nthat he was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung about all\r\nday, but he never came out. [26] fancy that he suspected something when\r\nDrebber failed to put in an appearance. He was cunning, was Stangerson,\r\nand always on his guard. If he thought he could keep me off by staying\r\nindoors he was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window\r\nof his bedroom, and early next morning I took advantage of some ladders\r\nwhich were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into\r\nhis room in the grey of the dawn. I woke him up and told him that the\r\nhour had come when he was to answer for the life he had taken so long\r\nbefore. I described Drebber's death to him, and I gave him the same\r\nchoice of the poisoned pills. Instead of grasping at the chance of\r\nsafety which that offered him, he sprang from his bed and flew at my\r\nthroat. In self-defence I stabbed him to the heart. It would have been\r\nthe same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his guilty\r\nhand to pick out anything but the poison.\r\n\r\n\"I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up.\r\nI went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I\r\ncould save enough to take me back to America. I was standing in the\r\nyard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called\r\nJefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B,\r\nBaker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I\r\nknew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly\r\nsnackled [27] as ever I saw in my life. That's the whole of my story,\r\ngentlemen. You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am\r\njust as much an officer of justice as you are.\"\r\n\r\nSo thrilling had the man's narrative been, and his manner was so\r\nimpressive that we had sat silent and absorbed. Even the professional\r\ndetectives, _blase_ as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to\r\nbe keenly interested in the man's story. When he finished we sat for\r\nsome minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching\r\nof Lestrade's pencil as he gave the finishing touches to his shorthand\r\naccount.\r\n\r\n\"There is only one point on which I should like a little more\r\ninformation,\" Sherlock Holmes said at last. \"Who was your accomplice who\r\ncame for the ring which I advertised?\"\r\n\r\nThe prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. \"I can tell my own secrets,\"\r\nhe said, \"but I don't get other people into trouble. I saw your\r\nadvertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the\r\nring which I wanted. My friend volunteered to go and see. I think you'll\r\nown he did it smartly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of that,\" said Holmes heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" the Inspector remarked gravely, \"the forms of the law\r\nmust be complied with. On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before\r\nthe magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will\r\nbe responsible for him.\" He rang the bell as he spoke, and Jefferson\r\nHope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our\r\nway out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.\r\n\nWE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the\r\nThursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our\r\ntestimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson\r\nHope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would\r\nbe meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism\r\nburst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the\r\ncell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been able\r\nin his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\"Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his death,\" Holmes remarked, as\r\nwe chatted it over next evening. \"Where will their grand advertisement\r\nbe now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see that they had very much to do with his capture,\" I\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\n\"What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,\" returned my\r\ncompanion, bitterly. \"The question is, what can you make people believe\r\nthat you have done. Never mind,\" he continued, more brightly, after a\r\npause. \"I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There\r\nhas been no better case within my recollection. Simple as it was, there\r\nwere several most instructive points about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simple!\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,\" said Sherlock\r\nHolmes, smiling at my surprise. \"The proof of its intrinsic simplicity\r\nis, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able\r\nto lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is\r\nusually a guide rather than a hindrance. In solving a problem of this\r\nsort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards. That is a very\r\nuseful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise\r\nit much. In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason\r\nforwards, and so the other comes to be neglected. There are fifty who\r\ncan reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.\"\r\n\r\n\"I confess,\" said I, \"that I do not quite follow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.\r\nMost people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you\r\nwhat the result would be. They can put those events together in their\r\nminds, and argue from them that something will come to pass. There are\r\nfew people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to\r\nevolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led\r\nup to that result. This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning\r\nbackwards, or analytically.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to\r\nfind everything else for yourself. Now let me endeavour to show you the\r\ndifferent steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached\r\nthe house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all\r\nimpressions. I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I\r\nhave already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which,\r\nI ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night. I\r\nsatisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the\r\nnarrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably\r\nless wide than a gentleman's brougham.\r\n\r\n\"This was the first point gained. I then walked slowly down the garden\r\npath, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable\r\nfor taking impressions. No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere\r\ntrampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its\r\nsurface had a meaning. There is no branch of detective science which\r\nis so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.\r\nHappily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice\r\nhas made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks of the\r\nconstables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed\r\nthrough the garden. It was easy to tell that they had been before the\r\nothers, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by\r\nthe others coming upon the top of them. In this way my second link was\r\nformed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number,\r\none remarkable for his height (as I calculated from the length of his\r\nstride), and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and\r\nelegant impression left by his boots.\r\n\r\n\"On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted\r\nman lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder\r\nthere was. There was no wound upon the dead man's person, but the\r\nagitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his\r\nfate before it came upon him. Men who die from heart disease, or any\r\nsudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their\r\nfeatures. Having sniffed the dead man's lips I detected a slightly sour\r\nsmell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon\r\nhim. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred\r\nand fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had\r\narrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.\r\nDo not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea. The forcible\r\nadministration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals.\r\nThe cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will\r\noccur at once to any toxicologist.\r\n\r\n\"And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not\r\nbeen the object of the murder, for nothing was taken. Was it politics,\r\nthen, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me.\r\nI was inclined from the first to the latter supposition. Political\r\nassassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. This murder\r\nhad, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator\r\nhad left his tracks all over the room, showing that he had been there\r\nall the time. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political\r\none, which called for such a methodical revenge. When the inscription\r\nwas discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my\r\nopinion. The thing was too evidently a blind. When the ring was found,\r\nhowever, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to\r\nremind his victim of some dead or absent woman. It was at this point\r\nthat I asked Gregson whether he had enquired in his telegram to\r\nCleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber's former career. He\r\nanswered, you remember, in the negative.\r\n\r\n\"I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which\r\nconfirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished me\r\nwith the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length\r\nof his nails. I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no\r\nsigns of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst\r\nfrom the murderer's nose in his excitement. I could perceive that the\r\ntrack of blood coincided with the track of his feet. It is seldom that\r\nany man, unless he is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through\r\nemotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a\r\nrobust and ruddy-faced man. Events proved that I had judged correctly.\r\n\r\n\"Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. I\r\ntelegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry\r\nto the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber. The\r\nanswer was conclusive. It told me that Drebber had already applied for\r\nthe protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson\r\nHope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe. I knew now that\r\nI held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to\r\nsecure the murderer.\r\n\r\n\"I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked\r\ninto the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven\r\nthe cab. The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered\r\non in a way which would have been impossible had there been anyone in\r\ncharge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he were inside\r\nthe house? Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry\r\nout a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third\r\nperson, who was sure to betray him. Lastly, supposing one man wished\r\nto dog another through London, what better means could he adopt than\r\nto turn cabdriver. All these considerations led me to the irresistible\r\nconclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the\r\nMetropolis.\r\n\r\n\"If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to\r\nbe. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be\r\nlikely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at\r\nleast, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose\r\nthat he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name\r\nin a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized\r\nmy Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every\r\ncab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.\r\nHow well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are\r\nstill fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an\r\nincident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in\r\nany case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into\r\npossession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised.\r\nYou see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break\r\nor flaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wonderful!\" I cried. \"Your merits should be publicly recognized.\r\nYou should publish an account of the case. If you won't, I will for\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may do what you like, Doctor,\" he answered. \"See here!\" he\r\ncontinued, handing a paper over to me, \"look at this!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the _Echo_ for the day, and the paragraph to which he pointed was\r\ndevoted to the case in question.\r\n\r\n\"The public,\" it said, \"have lost a sensational treat through the sudden\r\ndeath of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch\r\nDrebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson. The details of the case will\r\nprobably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority\r\nthat the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in\r\nwhich love and Mormonism bore a part. It seems that both the victims\r\nbelonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the\r\ndeceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City. If the case has had\r\nno other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner\r\nthe efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson\r\nto all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at\r\nhome, and not to carry them on to British soil. It is an open secret\r\nthat the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known\r\nScotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson. The man was\r\napprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\nwho has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective\r\nline, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some\r\ndegree of their skill. It is expected that a testimonial of some sort\r\nwill be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their\r\nservices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't I tell you so when we started?\" cried Sherlock Holmes with a\r\nlaugh. \"That's the result of all our Study in Scarlet: to get them a\r\ntestimonial!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" I answered, \"I have all the facts in my journal, and the\r\npublic shall know them. In the meantime you must make yourself contented\r\nby the consciousness of success, like the Roman miser--\r\n\r\n            \"'Populus me sibilat, at mihi plaudo\r\n       Ipse domi simul ac nummos contemplor in arca.'\"\r\n\n", "The Sign of the Four": "Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and\r\nhis hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case. With his long,\r\nwhite, nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle, and rolled back\r\nhis left shirt-cuff.  For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully\r\nupon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with\r\ninnumerable puncture-marks. Finally he thrust the sharp point home,\r\npressed down the tiny piston, and sank back into the velvet-lined\r\narm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThree times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance, but\r\ncustom had not reconciled my mind to it.  On the contrary, from day to\r\nday I had become more irritable at the sight, and my conscience swelled\r\nnightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to\r\nprotest.  Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver\r\nmy soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant\r\nair of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would\r\ncare to take anything approaching to a liberty.  His great powers, his\r\nmasterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many\r\nextraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nYet upon that afternoon, whether it was the Beaune which I had taken\r\nwith my lunch, or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme\r\ndeliberation of his manner, I suddenly felt that I could hold out no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\"Which is it to-day?\" I asked,--\"morphine or cocaine?\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he\r\nhad opened.  \"It is cocaine,\" he said,--\"a seven-per-cent. solution.\r\nWould you care to try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" I answered, brusquely.  \"My constitution has not got over\r\nthe Afghan campaign yet.  I cannot afford to throw any extra strain\r\nupon it.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at my vehemence.  \"Perhaps you are right, Watson,\" he said.\r\n\"I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one.  I find it,\r\nhowever, so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that\r\nits secondary action is a matter of small moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But consider!\" I said, earnestly.  \"Count the cost!  Your brain may,\r\nas you say, be roused and excited, but it is a pathological and morbid\r\nprocess, which involves increased tissue-change and may at last leave a\r\npermanent weakness.  You know, too, what a black reaction comes upon\r\nyou.  Surely the game is hardly worth the candle.  Why should you, for\r\na mere passing pleasure, risk the loss of those great powers with which\r\nyou have been endowed? Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to\r\nanother, but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to\r\nsome extent answerable.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not seem offended.  On the contrary, he put his finger-tips\r\ntogether and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair, like one who\r\nhas a relish for conversation.\r\n\r\n\"My mind,\" he said, \"rebels at stagnation.  Give me problems, give me\r\nwork, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate\r\nanalysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere.  I can dispense then\r\nwith artificial stimulants.  But I abhor the dull routine of existence.\r\nI crave for mental exaltation.  That is why I have chosen my own\r\nparticular profession,--or rather created it, for I am the only one in\r\nthe world.\"\r\n\r\n\"The only unofficial detective?\" I said, raising my eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"The only unofficial consulting detective,\" he answered.  \"I am the\r\nlast and highest court of appeal in detection.  When Gregson or\r\nLestrade or Athelney Jones are out of their depths--which, by the way,\r\nis their normal state--the matter is laid before me.  I examine the\r\ndata, as an expert, and pronounce a specialist's opinion.  I claim no\r\ncredit in such cases.  My name figures in no newspaper.  The work\r\nitself, the pleasure of finding a field for my peculiar powers, is my\r\nhighest reward.  But you have yourself had some experience of my\r\nmethods of work in the Jefferson Hope case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" said I, cordially.  \"I was never so struck by anything\r\nin my life.  I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat\r\nfantastic title of 'A Study in Scarlet.'\"\r\n\r\nHe shook his head sadly.  \"I glanced over it,\" said he. \"Honestly, I\r\ncannot congratulate you upon it.  Detection is, or ought to be, an\r\nexact science, and should be treated in the same cold and unemotional\r\nmanner.  You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism, which\r\nproduces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an\r\nelopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the romance was there,\" I remonstrated.  \"I could not tamper with\r\nthe facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Some facts should be suppressed, or at least a just sense of\r\nproportion should be observed in treating them.  The only point in the\r\ncase which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from\r\neffects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it.\"\r\n\r\nI was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially\r\ndesigned to please him.  I confess, too, that I was irritated by the\r\negotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be\r\ndevoted to his own special doings.  More than once during the years\r\nthat I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small\r\nvanity underlay my companion's quiet and didactic manner.  I made no\r\nremark, however, but sat nursing my wounded leg.  I had a Jezail bullet\r\nthrough it some time before, and, though it did not prevent me from\r\nwalking, it ached wearily at every change of the weather.\r\n\r\n\"My practice has extended recently to the Continent,\" said Holmes,\r\nafter a while, filling up his old brier-root pipe.  \"I was consulted\r\nlast week by Francois Le Villard, who, as you probably know, has come\r\nrather to the front lately in the French detective service.  He has all\r\nthe Celtic power of quick intuition, but he is deficient in the wide\r\nrange of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments\r\nof his art.  The case was concerned with a will, and possessed some\r\nfeatures of interest.  I was able to refer him to two parallel cases,\r\nthe one at Riga in 1857, and the other at St. Louis in 1871, which have\r\nsuggested to him the true solution.  Here is the letter which I had\r\nthis morning acknowledging my assistance.\"  He tossed over, as he\r\nspoke, a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper. I glanced my eyes down\r\nit, catching a profusion of notes of admiration, with stray\r\n\"magnifiques,\" \"coup-de-maitres,\" and \"tours-de-force,\" all testifying\r\nto the ardent admiration of the Frenchman.\r\n\r\n\"He speaks as a pupil to his master,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he rates my assistance too highly,\" said Sherlock Holmes, lightly.\r\n\"He has considerable gifts himself.  He possesses two out of the three\r\nqualities necessary for the ideal detective.  He has the power of\r\nobservation and that of deduction.  He is only wanting in knowledge;\r\nand that may come in time.  He is now translating my small works into\r\nFrench.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your works?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, didn't you know?\" he cried, laughing.  \"Yes, I have been guilty of\r\nseveral monographs.  They are all upon technical subjects.  Here, for\r\nexample, is one 'Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various\r\nTobaccoes.'  In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar-,\r\ncigarette-, and pipe-tobacco, with colored plates illustrating the\r\ndifference in the ash.  It is a point which is continually turning up\r\nin criminal trials, and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a\r\nclue.  If you can say definitely, for example, that some murder has\r\nbeen done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah, it obviously\r\nnarrows your field of search.  To the trained eye there is as much\r\ndifference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff\r\nof bird's-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have an extraordinary genius for minutiae,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I appreciate their importance.  Here is my monograph upon the tracing\r\nof footsteps, with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a\r\npreserver of impresses. Here, too, is a curious little work upon the\r\ninfluence of a trade upon the form of the hand, with lithotypes of the\r\nhands of slaters, sailors, corkcutters, compositors, weavers, and\r\ndiamond-polishers.  That is a matter of great practical interest to the\r\nscientific detective,--especially in cases of unclaimed bodies, or in\r\ndiscovering the antecedents of criminals.  But I weary you with my\r\nhobby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" I answered, earnestly.  \"It is of the greatest interest\r\nto me, especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your\r\npractical application of it.  But you spoke just now of observation and\r\ndeduction.  Surely the one to some extent implies the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, hardly,\" he answered, leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair,\r\nand sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe.  \"For example,\r\nobservation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street\r\nPost-Office this morning, but deduction lets me know that when there\r\nyou dispatched a telegram.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right!\" said I.  \"Right on both points!  But I confess that I don't\r\nsee how you arrived at it.  It was a sudden impulse upon my part, and I\r\nhave mentioned it to no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is simplicity itself,\" he remarked, chuckling at my surprise,--\"so\r\nabsurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous; and yet it may\r\nserve to define the limits of observation and of deduction.\r\nObservation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to\r\nyour instep.  Just opposite the Seymour Street Office they have taken\r\nup the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that\r\nit is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering.  The earth is of\r\nthis peculiar reddish tint which is found, as far as I know, nowhere\r\nelse in the neighborhood.  So much is observation.  The rest is\r\ndeduction.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then, did you deduce the telegram?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I knew that you had not written a letter, since I sat\r\nopposite to you all morning.  I see also in your open desk there that\r\nyou have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards.  What\r\ncould you go into the post-office for, then, but to send a wire?\r\nEliminate all other factors, and the one which remains must be the\r\ntruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this case it certainly is so,\" I replied, after a little thought.\r\n\"The thing, however, is, as you say, of the simplest. Would you think\r\nme impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test?\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it would prevent me from taking a\r\nsecond dose of cocaine.  I should be delighted to look into any problem\r\nwhich you might submit to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object\r\nin daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it\r\nin such a way that a trained observer might read it.  Now, I have here\r\na watch which has recently come into my possession.  Would you have the\r\nkindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the\r\nlate owner?\"\r\n\r\nI handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my\r\nheart, for the test was, as I thought, an impossible one, and I\r\nintended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he\r\noccasionally assumed.  He balanced the watch in his hand, gazed hard at\r\nthe dial, opened the back, and examined the works, first with his naked\r\neyes and then with a powerful convex lens.  I could hardly keep from\r\nsmiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and\r\nhanded it back.\r\n\r\n\"There are hardly any data,\" he remarked.  \"The watch has been recently\r\ncleaned, which robs me of my most suggestive facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" I answered.  \"It was cleaned before being sent to me.\"\r\nIn my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and\r\nimpotent excuse to cover his failure.  What data could he expect from\r\nan uncleaned watch?\r\n\r\n\"Though unsatisfactory, my research has not been entirely barren,\" he\r\nobserved, staring up at the ceiling with dreamy, lack-lustre eyes.\r\n\"Subject to your correction, I should judge that the watch belonged to\r\nyour elder brother, who inherited it from your father.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you gather, no doubt, from the H. W. upon the back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  The W. suggests your own name.  The date of the watch is\r\nnearly fifty years back, and the initials are as old as the watch:  so\r\nit was made for the last generation.  Jewelry usually descends to the\r\neldest son, and he is most likely to have the same name as the father.\r\nYour father has, if I remember right, been dead many years.  It has,\r\ntherefore, been in the hands of your eldest brother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, so far,\" said I.  \"Anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a man of untidy habits,--very untidy and careless.  He was left\r\nwith good prospects, but he threw away his chances, lived for some time\r\nin poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity, and finally,\r\ntaking to drink, he died.  That is all I can gather.\"\r\n\r\nI sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with\r\nconsiderable bitterness in my heart.\r\n\r\n\"This is unworthy of you, Holmes,\" I said.  \"I could not have believed\r\nthat you would have descended to this.  You have made inquires into the\r\nhistory of my unhappy brother, and you now pretend to deduce this\r\nknowledge in some fanciful way.  You cannot expect me to believe that\r\nyou have read all this from his old watch!  It is unkind, and, to speak\r\nplainly, has a touch of charlatanism in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear doctor,\" said he, kindly, \"pray accept my apologies. Viewing\r\nthe matter as an abstract problem, I had forgotten how personal and\r\npainful a thing it might be to you.  I assure you, however, that I\r\nnever even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts?\r\nThey are absolutely correct in every particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is good luck.  I could only say what was the balance of\r\nprobability.  I did not at all expect to be so accurate.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was not mere guess-work?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no:  I never guess.  It is a shocking habit,--destructive to the\r\nlogical faculty.  What seems strange to you is only so because you do\r\nnot follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which\r\nlarge inferences may depend.  For example, I began by stating that your\r\nbrother was careless.  When you observe the lower part of that\r\nwatch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places, but it\r\nis cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard\r\nobjects, such as coins or keys, in the same pocket.  Surely it is no\r\ngreat feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so\r\ncavalierly must be a careless man.  Neither is it a very far-fetched\r\ninference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty\r\nwell provided for in other respects.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, to show that I followed his reasoning.\r\n\r\n\"It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England, when they take a\r\nwatch, to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the\r\ninside of the case.  It is more handy than a label, as there is no risk\r\nof the number being lost or transposed.  There are no less than four\r\nsuch numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case.\r\nInference,--that your brother was often at low water.  Secondary\r\ninference,--that he had occasional bursts of prosperity, or he could\r\nnot have redeemed the pledge. Finally, I ask you to look at the inner\r\nplate, which contains the key-hole.  Look at the thousands of scratches\r\nall round the hole,--marks where the key has slipped.  What sober man's\r\nkey could have scored those grooves?  But you will never see a\r\ndrunkard's watch without them.  He winds it at night, and he leaves\r\nthese traces of his unsteady hand.  Where is the mystery in all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as clear as daylight,\" I answered.  \"I regret the injustice\r\nwhich I did you.  I should have had more faith in your marvellous\r\nfaculty.  May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot\r\nat present?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.  Hence the cocaine.  I cannot live without brain-work. What else\r\nis there to live for?  Stand at the window here.  Was ever such a\r\ndreary, dismal, unprofitable world?  See how the yellow fog swirls down\r\nthe street and drifts across the dun-colored houses.  What could be\r\nmore hopelessly prosaic and material?  What is the use of having\r\npowers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them?  Crime\r\nis commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those\r\nwhich are commonplace have any function upon earth.\"\r\n\r\nI had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade, when with a crisp knock\r\nour landlady entered, bearing a card upon the brass salver.\r\n\r\n\"A young lady for you, sir,\" she said, addressing my companion.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Mary Morstan,\" he read.  \"Hum!  I have no recollection of the\r\nname.  Ask the young lady to step up, Mrs. Hudson.  Don't go, doctor.\r\nI should prefer that you remain.\"\r\n\nMiss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure\r\nof manner.  She was a blonde young lady, small, dainty, well gloved,\r\nand dressed in the most perfect taste.  There was, however, a plainness\r\nand simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of\r\nlimited means.  The dress was a sombre grayish beige, untrimmed and\r\nunbraided, and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue, relieved\r\nonly by a suspicion of white feather in the side.  Her face had neither\r\nregularity of feature nor beauty of complexion, but her expression was\r\nsweet and amiable, and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual\r\nand sympathetic.  In an experience of women which extends over many\r\nnations and three separate continents, I have never looked upon a face\r\nwhich gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature. I could\r\nnot but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed\r\nfor her, her lip trembled, her hand quivered, and she showed every sign\r\nof intense inward agitation.\r\n\r\n\"I have come to you, Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"because you once enabled\r\nmy employer, Mrs. Cecil Forrester, to unravel a little domestic\r\ncomplication.  She was much impressed by your kindness and skill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\" he repeated thoughtfully.  \"I believe that I\r\nwas of some slight service to her.  The case, however, as I remember\r\nit, was a very simple one.\"\r\n\r\n\"She did not think so.  But at least you cannot say the same of mine.\r\nI can hardly imagine anything more strange, more utterly inexplicable,\r\nthan the situation in which I find myself.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes rubbed his hands, and his eyes glistened.  He leaned forward in\r\nhis chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his\r\nclear-cut, hawklike features.  \"State your case,\" said he, in brisk,\r\nbusiness tones.\r\n\r\nI felt that my position was an embarrassing one.  \"You will, I am sure,\r\nexcuse me,\" I said, rising from my chair.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me.\r\n\"If your friend,\" she said, \"would be good enough to stop, he might be\r\nof inestimable service to me.\"\r\n\r\nI relapsed into my chair.\r\n\r\n\"Briefly,\" she continued, \"the facts are these.  My father was an\r\nofficer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a\r\nchild.  My mother was dead, and I had no relative in England.  I was\r\nplaced, however, in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh,\r\nand there I remained until I was seventeen years of age.  In the year\r\n1878 my father, who was senior captain of his regiment, obtained twelve\r\nmonths' leave and came home.  He telegraphed to me from London that he\r\nhad arrived all safe, and directed me to come down at once, giving the\r\nLangham Hotel as his address.  His message, as I remember, was full of\r\nkindness and love.  On reaching London I drove to the Langham, and was\r\ninformed that Captain Morstan was staying there, but that he had gone\r\nout the night before and had not yet returned. I waited all day without\r\nnews of him.  That night, on the advice of the manager of the hotel, I\r\ncommunicated with the police, and next morning we advertised in all the\r\npapers.  Our inquiries led to no result; and from that day to this no\r\nword has ever been heard of my unfortunate father.  He came home with\r\nhis heart full of hope, to find some peace, some comfort, and\r\ninstead--\"  She put her hand to her throat, and a choking sob cut short\r\nthe sentence.\r\n\r\n\"The date?\" asked Holmes, opening his note-book.\r\n\r\n\"He disappeared upon the 3d of December, 1878,--nearly ten years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"His luggage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Remained at the hotel.  There was nothing in it to suggest a\r\nclue,--some clothes, some books, and a considerable number of\r\ncuriosities from the Andaman Islands.  He had been one of the officers\r\nin charge of the convict-guard there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had he any friends in town?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one that we know of,--Major Sholto, of his own regiment, the 34th\r\nBombay Infantry.  The major had retired some little time before, and\r\nlived at Upper Norwood.  We communicated with him, of course, but he\r\ndid not even know that his brother officer was in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"A singular case,\" remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"I have not yet described to you the most singular part.  About six\r\nyears ago--to be exact, upon the 4th of May, 1882--an advertisement\r\nappeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and\r\nstating that it would be to her advantage to come forward.  There was\r\nno name or address appended.  I had at that time just entered the\r\nfamily of Mrs. Cecil Forrester in the capacity of governess.  By her\r\nadvice I published my address in the advertisement column.  The same\r\nday there arrived through the post a small card-board box addressed to\r\nme, which I found to contain a very large and lustrous pearl.  No word\r\nof writing was enclosed.  Since then every year upon the same date\r\nthere has always appeared a similar box, containing a similar pearl,\r\nwithout any clue as to the sender.  They have been pronounced by an\r\nexpert to be of a rare variety and of considerable value.  You can see\r\nfor yourselves that they are very handsome.\"  She opened a flat box as\r\nshe spoke, and showed me six of the finest pearls that I had ever seen.\r\n\r\n\"Your statement is most interesting,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"Has\r\nanything else occurred to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and no later than to-day.  That is why I have come to you. This\r\nmorning I received this letter, which you will perhaps read for\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Holmes.  \"The envelope too, please.  Postmark,\r\nLondon, S.W.  Date, July 7.  Hum!  Man's thumb-mark on\r\ncorner,--probably postman.  Best quality paper.  Envelopes at sixpence\r\na packet.  Particular man in his stationery.  No address.  'Be at the\r\nthird pillar from the left outside the Lyceum Theatre to-night at seven\r\no'clock.  If you are distrustful, bring two friends.  You are a wronged\r\nwoman, and shall have justice.  Do not bring police.  If you do, all\r\nwill be in vain.  Your unknown friend.'  Well, really, this is a very\r\npretty little mystery. What do you intend to do, Miss Morstan?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is exactly what I want to ask you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall most certainly go.  You and I and--yes, why, Dr. Watson\r\nis the very man.  Your correspondent says two friends.  He and I have\r\nworked together before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But would he come?\" she asked, with something appealing in her voice\r\nand expression.\r\n\r\n\"I should be proud and happy,\" said I, fervently, \"if I can be of any\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are both very kind,\" she answered.  \"I have led a retired life,\r\nand have no friends whom I could appeal to.  If I am here at six it\r\nwill do, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must not be later,\" said Holmes.  \"There is one other point,\r\nhowever.  Is this handwriting the same as that upon the pearl-box\r\naddresses?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have them here,\" she answered, producing half a dozen pieces of\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n\"You are certainly a model client.  You have the correct intuition.\r\nLet us see, now.\"  He spread out the papers upon the table, and gave\r\nlittle darting glances from one to the other. \"They are disguised\r\nhands, except the letter,\" he said, presently, \"but there can be no\r\nquestion as to the authorship. See how the irrepressible Greek e will\r\nbreak out, and see the twirl of the final s.  They are undoubtedly by\r\nthe same person. I should not like to suggest false hopes, Miss\r\nMorstan, but is there any resemblance between this hand and that of\r\nyour father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing could be more unlike.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expected to hear you say so.  We shall look out for you, then, at\r\nsix.  Pray allow me to keep the papers.  I may look into the matter\r\nbefore then.  It is only half-past three.  Au revoir, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Au revoir,\" said our visitor, and, with a bright, kindly glance from\r\none to the other of us, she replaced her pearl-box in her bosom and\r\nhurried away.  Standing at the window, I watched her walking briskly\r\ndown the street, until the gray turban and white feather were but a\r\nspeck in the sombre crowd.\r\n\r\n\"What a very attractive woman!\" I exclaimed, turning to my companion.\r\n\r\nHe had lit his pipe again, and was leaning back with drooping eyelids.\r\n\"Is she?\" he said, languidly.  \"I did not observe.\"\r\n\r\n\"You really are an automaton,--a calculating-machine!\" I cried. \"There\r\nis something positively inhuman in you at times.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled gently.  \"It is of the first importance,\" he said, \"not to\r\nallow your judgment to be biased by personal qualities.  A client is to\r\nme a mere unit,--a factor in a problem.  The emotional qualities are\r\nantagonistic to clear reasoning.  I assure you that the most winning\r\nwoman I ever knew was hanged for poisoning three little children for\r\ntheir insurance-money, and the most repellant man of my acquaintance is\r\na philanthropist who has spent nearly a quarter of a million upon the\r\nLondon poor.\"\r\n\r\n\"In this case, however--\"\r\n\r\n\"I never make exceptions.  An exception disproves the rule.  Have you\r\never had occasion to study character in handwriting?  What do you make\r\nof this fellow's scribble?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is legible and regular,\" I answered.  \"A man of business habits and\r\nsome force of character.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head.  \"Look at his long letters,\" he said. \"They\r\nhardly rise above the common herd.  That d might be an a, and that l an\r\ne.  Men of character always differentiate their long letters, however\r\nillegibly they may write.  There is vacillation in his k's and\r\nself-esteem in his capitals.  I am going out now.  I have some few\r\nreferences to make.  Let me recommend this book,--one of the most\r\nremarkable ever penned.  It is Winwood Reade's 'Martyrdom of Man.'  I\r\nshall be back in an hour.\"\r\n\r\nI sat in the window with the volume in my hand, but my thoughts were\r\nfar from the daring speculations of the writer.  My mind ran upon our\r\nlate visitor,--her smiles, the deep rich tones of her voice, the\r\nstrange mystery which overhung her life.  If she were seventeen at the\r\ntime of her father's disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now,--a\r\nsweet age, when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a\r\nlittle sobered by experience.  So I sat and mused, until such dangerous\r\nthoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged\r\nfuriously into the latest treatise upon pathology.  What was I, an army\r\nsurgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account, that I should\r\ndare to think of such things?  She was a unit, a factor,--nothing more.\r\nIf my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man\r\nthan to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o'-the-wisps of the\r\nimagination.\r\n\nIt was half-past five before Holmes returned.  He was bright, eager,\r\nand in excellent spirits,--a mood which in his case alternated with\r\nfits of the blackest depression.\r\n\r\n\"There is no great mystery in this matter,\" he said, taking the cup of\r\ntea which I had poured out for him.  \"The facts appear to admit of only\r\none explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you have solved it already?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that would be too much to say. I have discovered a suggestive\r\nfact, that is all.  It is, however, VERY suggestive. The details are\r\nstill to be added.  I have just found, on consulting the back files of\r\nthe Times, that Major Sholto, of Upper Norword, late of the 34th Bombay\r\nInfantry, died upon the 28th of April, 1882.\"\r\n\r\n\"I may be very obtuse, Holmes, but I fail to see what this suggests.\"\r\n\r\n\"No?  You surprise me.  Look at it in this way, then.  Captain Morstan\r\ndisappears.  The only person in London whom he could have visited is\r\nMajor Sholto.  Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London.\r\nFour years later Sholto dies.  WITHIN A WEEK OF HIS DEATH Captain\r\nMorstan's daughter receives a valuable present, which is repeated from\r\nyear to year, and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a\r\nwronged woman.  What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of\r\nher father?  And why should the presents begin immediately after\r\nSholto's death, unless it is that Sholto's heir knows something of the\r\nmystery and desires to make compensation?  Have you any alternative\r\ntheory which will meet the facts?\"\r\n\r\n\"But what a strange compensation!  And how strangely made!  Why, too,\r\nshould he write a letter now, rather than six years ago? Again, the\r\nletter speaks of giving her justice.  What justice can she have?  It is\r\ntoo much to suppose that her father is still alive.  There is no other\r\ninjustice in her case that you know of.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are difficulties; there are certainly difficulties,\" said\r\nSherlock Holmes, pensively.  \"But our expedition of to-night will solve\r\nthem all.  Ah, here is a four-wheeler, and Miss Morstan is inside.  Are\r\nyou all ready?  Then we had better go down, for it is a little past the\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nI picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes\r\ntook his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket.  It\r\nwas clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious one.\r\n\r\nMiss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was\r\ncomposed, but pale.  She must have been more than woman if she did not\r\nfeel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were\r\nembarking, yet her self-control was perfect, and she readily answered\r\nthe few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her.\r\n\r\n\"Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa's,\" she said. \"His\r\nletters were full of allusions to the major.  He and papa were in\r\ncommand of the troops at the Andaman Islands, so they were thrown a\r\ngreat deal together.  By the way, a curious paper was found in papa's\r\ndesk which no one could understand.  I don't suppose that it is of the\r\nslightest importance, but I thought you might care to see it, so I\r\nbrought it with me.  It is here.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee.\r\nHe then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens.\r\n\r\n\"It is paper of native Indian manufacture,\" he remarked.  \"It has at\r\nsome time been pinned to a board.  The diagram upon it appears to be a\r\nplan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and\r\npassages.  At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it\r\nis '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing. In the left-hand corner\r\nis a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms\r\ntouching.  Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse characters,\r\n'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh, Abdullah Khan,\r\nDost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the\r\nmatter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance.  It has been kept\r\ncarefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as clean as the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was in his pocket-book that we found it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Preserve it carefully, then, Miss Morstan, for it may prove to be of\r\nuse to us.  I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much\r\ndeeper and more subtle than I at first supposed. I must reconsider my\r\nideas.\"  He leaned back in the cab, and I could see by his drawn brow\r\nand his vacant eye that he was thinking intently.  Miss Morstan and I\r\nchatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible\r\noutcome, but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until\r\nthe end of our journey.\r\n\r\nIt was a September evening, and not yet seven o'clock, but the day had\r\nbeen a dreary one, and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city.\r\nMud-colored clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets.  Down the\r\nStrand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw\r\na feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement.  The yellow glare\r\nfrom the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy, vaporous air, and\r\nthrew a murky, shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare.\r\nThere was, to my mind, something eerie and ghost-like in the endless\r\nprocession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of\r\nlight,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry.  Like all human kind,\r\nthey flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into the gloom\r\nonce more. I am not subject to impressions, but the dull, heavy\r\nevening, with the strange business upon which we were engaged, combined\r\nto make me nervous and depressed.  I could see from Miss Morstan's\r\nmanner that she was suffering from the same feeling.  Holmes alone\r\ncould rise superior to petty influences.  He held his open note-book\r\nupon his knee, and from time to time he jotted down figures and\r\nmemoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern.\r\n\r\nAt the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the\r\nside-entrances.  In front a continuous stream of hansoms and\r\nfour-wheelers were rattling up, discharging their cargoes of\r\nshirt-fronted men and beshawled, bediamonded women.  We had hardly\r\nreached the third pillar, which was our rendezvous, before a small,\r\ndark, brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us.\r\n\r\n\"Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I am Miss Morstan, and these two gentlemen are my friends,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us.\r\n\"You will excuse me, miss,\" he said with a certain dogged manner, \"but\r\nI was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions\r\nis a police-officer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you my word on that,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nHe gave a shrill whistle, on which a street Arab led across a\r\nfour-wheeler and opened the door.  The man who had addressed us mounted\r\nto the box, while we took our places inside.  We had hardly done so\r\nbefore the driver whipped up his horse, and we plunged away at a\r\nfurious pace through the foggy streets.\r\n\r\nThe situation was a curious one.  We were driving to an unknown place,\r\non an unknown errand.  Yet our invitation was either a complete\r\nhoax,--which was an inconceivable hypothesis,--or else we had good\r\nreason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey.\r\nMiss Morstan's demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever.  I\r\nendeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in\r\nAfghanistan; but, to tell the truth, I was myself so excited at our\r\nsituation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were\r\nslightly involved.  To this day she declares that I told her one moving\r\nanecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night,\r\nand how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it.  At first I had\r\nsome idea as to the direction in which we were driving; but soon, what\r\nwith our pace, the fog, and my own limited knowledge of London, I lost\r\nmy bearings, and knew nothing, save that we seemed to be going a very\r\nlong way.  Sherlock Holmes was never at fault, however, and he muttered\r\nthe names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous\r\nby-streets.\r\n\r\n\"Rochester Row,\" said he.  \"Now Vincent Square.  Now we come out on the\r\nVauxhall Bridge Road.  We are making for the Surrey side, apparently.\r\nYes, I thought so.  Now we are on the bridge.  You can catch glimpses\r\nof the river.\"\r\n\r\nWe did indeed get a fleeting view of a stretch of the Thames with the\r\nlamps shining upon the broad, silent water; but our cab dashed on, and\r\nwas soon involved in a labyrinth of streets upon the other side.\r\n\r\n\"Wordsworth Road,\" said my companion.  \"Priory Road.  Lark Hall Lane.\r\nStockwell Place.  Robert Street.  Cold Harbor Lane.  Our quest does not\r\nappear to take us to very fashionable regions.\"\r\n\r\nWe had, indeed, reached a questionable and forbidding neighborhood.\r\nLong lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare\r\nand tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner.  Then came rows\r\nof two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden, and\r\nthen again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings,--the\r\nmonster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the\r\ncountry.  At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace.\r\nNone of the other houses were inhabited, and that at which we stopped\r\nwas as dark as its neighbors, save for a single glimmer in the kitchen\r\nwindow.  On our knocking, however, the door was instantly thrown open\r\nby a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban, white loose-fitting\r\nclothes, and a yellow sash.  There was something strangely incongruous\r\nin this Oriental figure framed in the commonplace door-way of a\r\nthird-rate suburban dwelling-house.\r\n\r\n\"The Sahib awaits you,\" said he, and even as he spoke there came a high\r\npiping voice from some inner room.  \"Show them in to me, khitmutgar,\"\r\nit cried.  \"Show them straight in to me.\"\r\n\nWe followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill lit and\r\nworse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw\r\nopen.  A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre\r\nof the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle\r\nof red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which\r\nshot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees.  He writhed\r\nhis hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual\r\njerk, now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose.\r\nNature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow\r\nand irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly\r\npassing his hand over the lower part of his face.  In spite of his\r\nobtrusive baldness, he gave the impression of youth.  In point of fact\r\nhe had just turned his thirtieth year.\r\n\r\n\"Your servant, Miss Morstan,\" he kept repeating, in a thin, high voice.\r\n\"Your servant, gentlemen.  Pray step into my little sanctum.  A small\r\nplace, miss, but furnished to my own liking. An oasis of art in the\r\nhowling desert of South London.\"\r\n\r\nWe were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he\r\ninvited us.  In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond\r\nof the first water in a setting of brass.  The richest and glossiest of\r\ncurtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to\r\nexpose some richly-mounted painting or Oriental vase.  The carpet was\r\nof amber-and-black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly\r\ninto it, as into a bed of moss.  Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart\r\nit increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah\r\nwhich stood upon a mat in the corner.  A lamp in the fashion of a\r\nsilver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre\r\nof the room.  As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic\r\nodor.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\" said the little man, still jerking and smiling.\r\n\"That is my name.  You are Miss Morstan, of course. And these\r\ngentlemen--\"\r\n\r\n\"This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this is Dr. Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"A doctor, eh?\" cried he, much excited.  \"Have you your stethoscope?\r\nMight I ask you--would you have the kindness?  I have grave doubts as\r\nto my mitral valve, if you would be so very good.  The aortic I may\r\nrely upon, but I should value your opinion upon the mitral.\"\r\n\r\nI listened to his heart, as requested, but was unable to find anything\r\namiss, save indeed that he was in an ecstasy of fear, for he shivered\r\nfrom head to foot.  \"It appears to be normal,\" I said.  \"You have no\r\ncause for uneasiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse my anxiety, Miss Morstan,\" he remarked, airily. \"I am\r\na great sufferer, and I have long had suspicions as to that valve.  I\r\nam delighted to hear that they are unwarranted.  Had your father, Miss\r\nMorstan, refrained from throwing a strain upon his heart, he might have\r\nbeen alive now.\"\r\n\r\nI could have struck the man across the face, so hot was I at this\r\ncallous and off-hand reference to so delicate a matter.  Miss Morstan\r\nsat down, and her face grew white to the lips.  \"I knew in my heart\r\nthat he was dead,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I can give you every information,\" said he, \"and, what is more, I can\r\ndo you justice; and I will, too, whatever Brother Bartholomew may say.\r\nI am so glad to have your friends here, not only as an escort to you,\r\nbut also as witnesses to what I am about to do and say.  The three of\r\nus can show a bold front to Brother Bartholomew.  But let us have no\r\noutsiders,--no police or officials.  We can settle everything\r\nsatisfactorily among ourselves, without any interference.  Nothing\r\nwould annoy Brother Bartholomew more than any publicity.\"  He sat down\r\nupon a low settee and blinked at us inquiringly with his weak, watery\r\nblue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" said Holmes, \"whatever you may choose to say will go no\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded to show my agreement.\r\n\r\n\"That is well!  That is well!\" said he.  \"May I offer you a glass of\r\nChianti, Miss Morstan?  Or of Tokay?  I keep no other wines. Shall I\r\nopen a flask?  No?  Well, then, I trust that you have no objection to\r\ntobacco-smoke, to the mild balsamic odor of the Eastern tobacco.  I am\r\na little nervous, and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative.\"  He\r\napplied a taper to the great bowl, and the smoke bubbled merrily\r\nthrough the rose-water.  We sat all three in a semicircle, with our\r\nheads advanced, and our chins upon our hands, while the strange, jerky\r\nlittle fellow, with his high, shining head, puffed uneasily in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n\"When I first determined to make this communication to you,\" said he,\r\n\"I might have given you my address, but I feared that you might\r\ndisregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you. I took the\r\nliberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man\r\nWilliams might be able to see you first.  I have complete confidence in\r\nhis discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed\r\nno further in the matter.  You will excuse these precautions, but I am\r\na man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and\r\nthere is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman.  I have a natural\r\nshrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact\r\nwith the rough crowd.  I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere\r\nof elegance around me.  I may call myself a patron of the arts.  It is\r\nmy weakness.  The landscape is a genuine Corot, and, though a\r\nconnoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there\r\ncannot be the least question about the Bouguereau.  I am partial to the\r\nmodern French school.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me, Mr. Sholto,\" said Miss Morstan, \"but I am here at\r\nyour request to learn something which you desire to tell me.  It is\r\nvery late, and I should desire the interview to be as short as\r\npossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the best it must take some time,\" he answered; \"for we shall\r\ncertainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew.  We shall\r\nall go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew.  He is\r\nvery angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me.\r\nI had quite high words with him last night.  You cannot imagine what a\r\nterrible fellow he is when he is angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at\r\nonce,\" I ventured to remark.\r\n\r\nHe laughed until his ears were quite red.  \"That would hardly do,\" he\r\ncried.  \"I don't know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden\r\nway.  No, I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each\r\nother. In the first place, I must tell you that there are several\r\npoints in the story of which I am myself ignorant.  I can only lay the\r\nfacts before you as far as I know them myself.\r\n\r\n\"My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the\r\nIndian army.  He retired some eleven years ago, and came to live at\r\nPondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood.  He had prospered in India, and\r\nbrought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection\r\nof valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants.  With these\r\nadvantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury.  My\r\ntwin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children.\r\n\r\n\"I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the\r\ndisappearance of Captain Morstan.  We read the details in the papers,\r\nand, knowing that he had been a friend of our father's, we discussed\r\nthe case freely in his presence.  He used to join in our speculations\r\nas to what could have happened.  Never for an instant did we suspect\r\nthat he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast,--that of all men\r\nhe alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan.\r\n\r\n\"We did know, however, that some mystery--some positive\r\ndanger--overhung our father.  He was very fearful of going out alone,\r\nand he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at\r\nPondicherry Lodge.  Williams, who drove you to-night, was one of them.\r\nHe was once light-weight champion of England.  Our father would never\r\ntell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men\r\nwith wooden legs.  On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a\r\nwooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for\r\norders.  We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up.  My brother\r\nand I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have\r\nsince led us to change our opinion.\r\n\r\n\"Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great\r\nshock to him.  He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened\r\nit, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter\r\nwe could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was\r\nshort and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from\r\nan enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the\r\nend of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he\r\nwished to make a last communication to us.\r\n\r\n\"When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing\r\nheavily.  He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side\r\nof the bed.  Then, grasping our hands, he made a remarkable statement\r\nto us, in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain.  I\r\nshall try and give it to you in his own very words.\r\n\r\n\"'I have only one thing,' he said, 'which weighs upon my mind at this\r\nsupreme moment.  It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan.  The\r\ncursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld\r\nfrom her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers.\r\nAnd yet I have made no use of it myself,--so blind and foolish a thing\r\nis avarice.  The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that\r\nI could not bear to share it with another.  See that chaplet dipped\r\nwith pearls beside the quinine-bottle.  Even that I could not bear to\r\npart with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to\r\nher. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But\r\nsend her nothing--not even the chaplet--until I am gone. After all, men\r\nhave been as bad as this and have recovered.\r\n\r\n\"'I will tell you how Morstan died,' he continued.  'He had suffered\r\nfor years from a weak heart, but he concealed it from every one.  I\r\nalone knew it.  When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of\r\ncircumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure.  I\r\nbrought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he\r\ncame straight over here to claim his share.  He walked over from the\r\nstation, and was admitted by my faithful Lal Chowdar, who is now dead.\r\nMorstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the\r\ntreasure, and we came to heated words.  Morstan had sprung out of his\r\nchair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his\r\nside, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backwards, cutting his\r\nhead against the corner of the treasure-chest.  When I stooped over him\r\nI found, to my horror, that he was dead.\r\n\r\n\"'For a long time I sat half distracted, wondering what I should do.\r\nMy first impulse was, of course, to call for assistance; but I could\r\nnot but recognize that there was every chance that I would be accused\r\nof his murder.  His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in\r\nhis head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could\r\nnot be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I\r\nwas particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul\r\nupon earth knew where he had gone.  There seemed to be no necessity why\r\nany soul ever should know.\r\n\r\n\"'I was still pondering over the matter, when, looking up, I saw my\r\nservant, Lal Chowdar, in the doorway.  He stole in and bolted the door\r\nbehind him.  \"Do not fear, Sahib,\" he said.  \"No one need know that you\r\nhave killed him.  Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?\" \"I did\r\nnot kill him,\" said I.  Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled.  \"I\r\nheard it all, Sahib,\" said he.  \"I heard you quarrel, and I heard the\r\nblow.  But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house.  Let us put\r\nhim away together.\" That was enough to decide me.  If my own servant\r\ncould not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before\r\ntwelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box?  Lal Chowdar and I disposed of\r\nthe body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full\r\nof the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan.  You will see from\r\nwhat I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter.  My fault lies in\r\nthe fact that we concealed not only the body, but also the treasure,\r\nand that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own.  I wish\r\nyou, therefore, to make restitution.  Put your ears down to my mouth.\r\nThe treasure is hidden in--'  At this instant a horrible change came\r\nover his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he\r\nyelled, in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out!  For\r\nChrist's sake keep him out!'  We both stared round at the window behind\r\nus upon which his gaze was fixed.  A face was looking in at us out of\r\nthe darkness.  We could see the whitening of the nose where it was\r\npressed against the glass.  It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild\r\ncruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother\r\nand I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone.  When we\r\nreturned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to\r\nbeat.\r\n\r\n\"We searched the garden that night, but found no sign of the intruder,\r\nsave that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the\r\nflower-bed.  But for that one trace, we might have thought that our\r\nimaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face.  We soon, however,\r\nhad another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies\r\nat work all round us.  The window of my father's room was found open in\r\nthe morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his\r\nchest was fixed a torn piece of paper, with the words 'The sign of the\r\nfour' scrawled across it.  What the phrase meant, or who our secret\r\nvisitor may have been, we never knew.  As far as we can judge, none of\r\nmy father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had\r\nbeen turned out.  My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar\r\nincident with the fear which haunted my father during his life; but it\r\nis still a complete mystery to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully\r\nfor a few moments.  We had all sat absorbed, listening to his\r\nextraordinary narrative.  At the short account of her father's death\r\nMiss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that\r\nshe was about to faint.  She rallied however, on drinking a glass of\r\nwater which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon\r\nthe side-table.  Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an\r\nabstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes.\r\nAs I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had\r\ncomplained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life.  Here at least was\r\na problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost.  Mr. Thaddeus\r\nSholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the\r\neffect which his story had produced, and then continued between the\r\npuffs of his overgrown pipe.\r\n\r\n\"My brother and I,\" said he, \"were, as you may imagine, much excited as\r\nto the treasure which my father had spoken of.  For weeks and for\r\nmonths we dug and delved in every part of the garden, without\r\ndiscovering its whereabouts.  It was maddening to think that the\r\nhiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died.  We could\r\njudge the splendor of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had\r\ntaken out.  Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some\r\nlittle discussion.  The pearls were evidently of great value, and he\r\nwas averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was\r\nhimself a little inclined to my father's fault.  He thought, too, that\r\nif we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally\r\nbring us into trouble.  It was all that I could do to persuade him to\r\nlet me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at\r\nfixed intervals, so that at least she might never feel destitute.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a kindly thought,\" said our companion, earnestly.  \"It was\r\nextremely good of you.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man waved his hand deprecatingly.  \"We were your trustees,\"\r\nhe said.  \"That was the view which I took of it, though Brother\r\nBartholomew could not altogether see it in that light.  We had plenty\r\nof money ourselves.  I desired no more. Besides, it would have been\r\nsuch bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. 'Le\r\nmauvais gout mene au crime.'  The French have a very neat way of\r\nputting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so\r\nfar that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself:  so I left\r\nPondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me.\r\nYesterday, however, I learn that an event of extreme importance has\r\noccurred.  The treasure has been discovered.  I instantly communicated\r\nwith Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood\r\nand demand our share.  I explained my views last night to Brother\r\nBartholomew:  so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Thaddeus Sholto ceased, and sat twitching on his luxurious settee.\r\nWe all remained silent, with our thoughts upon the new development\r\nwhich the mysterious business had taken.  Holmes was the first to\r\nspring to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"You have done well, sir, from first to last,\" said he.  \"It is\r\npossible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing\r\nsome light upon that which is still dark to you.  But, as Miss Morstan\r\nremarked just now, it is late, and we had best put the matter through\r\nwithout delay.\"\r\n\r\nOur new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his\r\nhookah, and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged\r\ntopcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs.  This he buttoned tightly up,\r\nin spite of the extreme closeness of the night, and finished his attire\r\nby putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the\r\nears, so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky\r\nface.  \"My health is somewhat fragile,\" he remarked, as he led the way\r\ndown the passage.  \"I am compelled to be a valetudinarian.\"\r\n\r\nOur cab was awaiting us outside, and our programme was evidently\r\nprearranged, for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace.\r\nThaddeus Sholto talked incessantly, in a voice which rose high above\r\nthe rattle of the wheels.\r\n\r\n\"Bartholomew is a clever fellow,\" said he.  \"How do you think he found\r\nout where the treasure was?  He had come to the conclusion that it was\r\nsomewhere indoors:  so he worked out all the cubic space of the house,\r\nand made measurements everywhere, so that not one inch should be\r\nunaccounted for.  Among other things, he found that the height of the\r\nbuilding was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of\r\nall the separate rooms, and making every allowance for the space\r\nbetween, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total\r\nto more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for.  These\r\ncould only be at the top of the building.  He knocked a hole,\r\ntherefore, in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room, and\r\nthere, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which\r\nhad been sealed up and was known to no one.  In the centre stood the\r\ntreasure-chest, resting upon two rafters.  He lowered it through the\r\nhole, and there it lies.  He computes the value of the jewels at not\r\nless than half a million sterling.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another\r\nopen-eyed.  Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from\r\na needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the\r\nplace of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news; yet I am ashamed to\r\nsay that selfishness took me by the soul, and that my heart turned as\r\nheavy as lead within me.  I stammered out some few halting words of\r\ncongratulation, and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to\r\nthe babble of our new acquaintance.  He was clearly a confirmed\r\nhypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth\r\ninterminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the\r\ncomposition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he\r\nbore about in a leather case in his pocket.  I trust that he may not\r\nremember any of the answers which I gave him that night.  Holmes\r\ndeclares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of\r\ntaking more than two drops of castor oil, while I recommended\r\nstrychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was\r\ncertainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman\r\nsprang down to open the door.\r\n\r\n\"This, Miss Morstan, is Pondicherry Lodge,\" said Mr. Thaddeus Sholto,\r\nas he handed her out.\r\n\nIt was nearly eleven o'clock when we reached this final stage of our\r\nnight's adventures.  We had left the damp fog of the great city behind\r\nus, and the night was fairly fine.  A warm wind blew from the westward,\r\nand heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky, with half a moon peeping\r\noccasionally through the rifts.  It was clear enough to see for some\r\ndistance, but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the\r\ncarriage to give us a better light upon our way.\r\n\r\nPondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds, and was girt round with a\r\nvery high stone wall topped with broken glass.  A single narrow\r\niron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance. On this our guide\r\nknocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" cried a gruff voice from within.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, McMurdo.  You surely know my knock by this time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys. The\r\ndoor swung heavily back, and a short, deep-chested man stood in the\r\nopening, with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his\r\nprotruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"That you, Mr. Thaddeus?  But who are the others?  I had no orders\r\nabout them from the master.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, McMurdo?  You surprise me!  I told my brother last night that I\r\nshould bring some friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"He ain't been out o' his room to-day, Mr. Thaddeus, and I have no\r\norders.  You know very well that I must stick to regulations. I can let\r\nyou in, but your friends must just stop where they are.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an unexpected obstacle.  Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a\r\nperplexed and helpless manner.  \"This is too bad of you, McMurdo!\" he\r\nsaid.  \"If I guarantee them, that is enough for you. There is the young\r\nlady, too.  She cannot wait on the public road at this hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus,\" said the porter, inexorably.  \"Folk may be\r\nfriends o' yours, and yet no friends o' the master's.  He pays me well\r\nto do my duty, and my duty I'll do.  I don't know none o' your friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes you do, McMurdo,\" cried Sherlock Holmes, genially.  \"I don't\r\nthink you can have forgotten me.  Don't you remember the amateur who\r\nfought three rounds with you at Alison's rooms on the night of your\r\nbenefit four years back?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" roared the prize-fighter.  \"God's truth! how\r\ncould I have mistook you?  If instead o' standin' there so quiet you\r\nhad just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw,\r\nI'd ha' known you without a question. Ah, you're one that has wasted\r\nyour gifts, you have!  You might have aimed high, if you had joined the\r\nfancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Watson, if all else fails me I have still one of the\r\nscientific professions open to me,\" said Holmes, laughing.  \"Our friend\r\nwon't keep us out in the cold now, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"In you come, sir, in you come,--you and your friends,\" he answered.\r\n\"Very sorry, Mr. Thaddeus, but orders are very strict. Had to be\r\ncertain of your friends before I let them in.\"\r\n\r\nInside, a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of\r\na house, square and prosaic, all plunged in shadow save where a\r\nmoonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window.  The vast\r\nsize of the building, with its gloom and its deathly silence, struck a\r\nchill to the heart.  Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease, and the\r\nlantern quivered and rattled in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand it,\" he said.  \"There must be some mistake. I\r\ndistinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here, and yet there is no\r\nlight in his window.  I do not know what to make of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he always guard the premises in this way?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he has followed my father's custom.  He was the favorite son, you\r\nknow, and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than\r\nhe ever told me.  That is Bartholomew's window up there where the\r\nmoonshine strikes.  It is quite bright, but there is no light from\r\nwithin, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" said Holmes.  \"But I see the glint of a light in that little\r\nwindow beside the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is the housekeeper's room.  That is where old Mrs. Bernstone\r\nsits.  She can tell us all about it.  But perhaps you would not mind\r\nwaiting here for a minute or two, for if we all go in together and she\r\nhas no word of our coming she may be alarmed. But hush! what is that?\"\r\n\r\nHe held up the lantern, and his hand shook until the circles of light\r\nflickered and wavered all round us.  Miss Morstan seized my wrist, and\r\nwe all stood with thumping hearts, straining our ears. From the great\r\nblack house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most\r\npitiful of sounds,--the shrill, broken whimpering of a frightened woman.\r\n\r\n\"It is Mrs. Bernstone,\" said Sholto.  \"She is the only woman in the\r\nhouse.  Wait here.  I shall be back in a moment.\"  He hurried for the\r\ndoor, and knocked in his peculiar way.  We could see a tall old woman\r\nadmit him, and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Thaddeus, sir, I am so glad you have come!  I am so glad you\r\nhave come, Mr. Thaddeus, sir!\"  We heard her reiterated rejoicings\r\nuntil the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled\r\nmonotone.\r\n\r\nOur guide had left us the lantern.  Holmes swung it slowly round, and\r\npeered keenly at the house, and at the great rubbish-heaps which\r\ncumbered the grounds.  Miss Morstan and I stood together, and her hand\r\nwas in mine.  A wondrous subtle thing is love, for here were we two who\r\nhad never seen each other before that day, between whom no word or even\r\nlook of affection had ever passed, and yet now in an hour of trouble\r\nour hands instinctively sought for each other.  I have marvelled at it\r\nsince, but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should\r\ngo out to her so, and, as she has often told me, there was in her also\r\nthe instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection.  So we stood\r\nhand in hand, like two children, and there was peace in our hearts for\r\nall the dark things that surrounded us.\r\n\r\n\"What a strange place!\" she said, looking round.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it.\r\nI have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat,\r\nwhere the prospectors had been at work.\"\r\n\r\n\"And from the same cause,\" said Holmes.  \"These are the traces of the\r\ntreasure-seekers.  You must remember that they were six years looking\r\nfor it.  No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto\r\ncame running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"There is something amiss with Bartholomew!\" he cried.  \"I am\r\nfrightened!  My nerves cannot stand it.\"  He was, indeed, half\r\nblubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from\r\nthe great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a\r\nterrified child.\r\n\r\n\"Come into the house,\" said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do!\" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto.  \"I really do not feel equal to\r\ngiving directions.\"\r\n\r\nWe all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the\r\nleft-hand side of the passage.  The old woman was pacing up and down\r\nwith a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of Miss\r\nMorstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.\r\n\r\n\"God bless your sweet calm face!\" she cried, with an hysterical sob.\r\n\"It does me good to see you.  Oh, but I have been sorely tried this\r\nday!\"\r\n\r\nOur companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few\r\nwords of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the\r\nothers bloodless cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"Master has locked himself in and will not answer me,\" she explained.\r\n\"All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be\r\nalone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went up\r\nand peeped through the key-hole.  You must go up, Mr. Thaddeus,--you\r\nmust go up and look for yourself.  I have seen Mr. Bartholomew Sholto\r\nin joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I never saw him with such\r\na face on him as that.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's\r\nteeth were chattering in his head.  So shaken was he that I had to pass\r\nmy hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees were\r\ntrembling under him.  Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out\r\nof his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be\r\nmere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served\r\nas a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step, holding the\r\nlamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left.  Miss Morstan had\r\nremained behind with the frightened housekeeper.\r\n\r\nThe third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length,\r\nwith a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three\r\ndoors upon the left.  Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and\r\nmethodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our long black\r\nshadows streaming backwards down the corridor.  The third door was that\r\nwhich we were seeking.  Holmes knocked without receiving any answer,\r\nand then tried to turn the handle and force it open.  It was locked on\r\nthe inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt, as we could see\r\nwhen we set our lamp up against it.  The key being turned, however, the\r\nhole was not entirely closed.  Sherlock Holmes bent down to it, and\r\ninstantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath.\r\n\r\n\"There is something devilish in this, Watson,\" said he, more moved than\r\nI had ever before seen him.  \"What do you make of it?\"\r\n\r\nI stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror.  Moonlight was streaming\r\ninto the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance.\r\nLooking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the air, for all\r\nbeneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face of our\r\ncompanion Thaddeus.  There was the same high, shining head, the same\r\ncircular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.  The\r\nfeatures were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and unnatural\r\ngrin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the\r\nnerves than any scowl or contortion.  So like was the face to that of\r\nour little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was\r\nindeed with us.  Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us\r\nthat his brother and he were twins.\r\n\r\n\"This is terrible!\" I said to Holmes.  \"What is to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"The door must come down,\" he answered, and, springing against it, he\r\nput all his weight upon the lock.  It creaked and groaned, but did not\r\nyield.  Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time it\r\ngave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within Bartholomew\r\nSholto's chamber.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory.  A double\r\nline of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the\r\ndoor, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners, test-tubes,\r\nand retorts.  In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets.\r\nOne of these appeared to leak or to have been broken, for a stream of\r\ndark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the air was heavy\r\nwith a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor.  A set of steps stood at one\r\nside of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster, and\r\nabove them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man\r\nto pass through.  At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was\r\nthrown carelessly together.\r\n\r\nBy the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was seated\r\nall in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and that\r\nghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face.  He was stiff and cold, and\r\nhad clearly been dead many hours.  It seemed to me that not only his\r\nfeatures but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most\r\nfantastic fashion.  By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar\r\ninstrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a\r\nhammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine.  Beside it was a torn sheet\r\nof note-paper with some words scrawled upon it.  Holmes glanced at it,\r\nand then handed it to me.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, \"The sign\r\nof the four.\"\r\n\r\n\"In God's name, what does it all mean?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It means murder,\" said he, stooping over the dead man.  \"Ah, I\r\nexpected it.  Look here!\"  He pointed to what looked like a long, dark\r\nthorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like a thorn,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"It is a thorn.  You may pick it out.  But be careful, for it is\r\npoisoned.\"\r\n\r\nI took it up between my finger and thumb.  It came away from the skin\r\nso readily that hardly any mark was left behind.  One tiny speck of\r\nblood showed where the puncture had been.\r\n\r\n\"This is all an insoluble mystery to me,\" said I.  \"It grows darker\r\ninstead of clearer.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" he answered, \"it clears every instant.  I only\r\nrequire a few missing links to have an entirely connected case.\"\r\n\r\nWe had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the\r\nchamber.  He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of\r\nterror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,\r\nhe broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.\r\n\r\n\"The treasure is gone!\" he said.  \"They have robbed him of the\r\ntreasure!  There is the hole through which we lowered it.  I helped him\r\nto do it!  I was the last person who saw him!  I left him here last\r\nnight, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was ten o'clock.  And now he is dead, and the police will be called\r\nin, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh, yes, I am\r\nsure I shall.  But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you don't\r\nthink that it was I?  Is it likely that I would have brought you here\r\nif it were I?  Oh, dear! oh, dear!  I know that I shall go mad!\"  He\r\njerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy.\r\n\r\n\"You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes, kindly, putting\r\nhis hand upon his shoulder.  \"Take my advice, and drive down to the\r\nstation to report this matter to the police.  Offer to assist them in\r\nevery way.  We shall wait here until your return.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him\r\nstumbling down the stairs in the dark.\r\n\n\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, rubbing his hands, \"we have half an hour to\r\nourselves.  Let us make good use of it.  My case is, as I have told\r\nyou, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of\r\nover-confidence.  Simple as the case seems now, there may be something\r\ndeeper underlying it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Simple!\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor\r\nexpounding to his class.  \"Just sit in the corner there, that your\r\nfootprints may not complicate matters.  Now to work!  In the first\r\nplace, how did these folk come, and how did they go?  The door has not\r\nbeen opened since last night.  How of the window?\"  He carried the lamp\r\nacross to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but\r\naddressing them to himself rather than to me.  \"Window is snibbed on\r\nthe inner side. Framework is solid.  No hinges at the side.  Let us\r\nopen it.  No water-pipe near.  Roof quite out of reach.  Yet a man has\r\nmounted by the window. It rained a little last night.  Here is the\r\nprint of a foot in mould upon the sill.  And here is a circular muddy\r\nmark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See\r\nhere, Watson!  This is really a very pretty demonstration.\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs.  \"This is not a\r\nfootmark,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a\r\nwooden stump.  You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot\r\nwith the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the wooden-legged man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  But there has been some one else,--a very able and\r\nefficient ally.  Could you scale that wall, doctor?\"\r\n\r\nI looked out of the open window.  The moon still shone brightly on that\r\nangle of the house.  We were a good sixty feet from the ground, and,\r\nlook where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a crevice\r\nin the brick-work.\r\n\r\n\"It is absolutely impossible,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Without aid it is so.  But suppose you had a friend up here who\r\nlowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing\r\none end of it to this great hook in the wall.  Then, I think, if you\r\nwere an active man, You might swarm up, wooden leg and all.  You would\r\ndepart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up the\r\nrope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the inside,\r\nand get away in the way that he originally came.  As a minor point it\r\nmay be noted,\" he continued, fingering the rope, \"that our\r\nwooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional\r\nsailor.  His hands were far from horny.  My lens discloses more than\r\none blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I\r\ngather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin\r\noff his hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is all very well,\" said I, \"but the thing becomes more\r\nunintelligible than ever.  How about this mysterious ally?  How came he\r\ninto the room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the ally!\" repeated Holmes, pensively.  \"There are features of\r\ninterest about this ally.  He lifts the case from the regions of the\r\ncommonplace.  I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals\r\nof crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves\r\nfrom India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia.\"\r\n\r\n\"How came he, then?\"  I reiterated.  \"The door is locked, the window is\r\ninaccessible.  Was it through the chimney?\"\r\n\r\n\"The grate is much too small,\" he answered.  \"I had already considered\r\nthat possibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"How then?\" I persisted.\r\n\r\n\"You will not apply my precept,\" he said, shaking his head.  \"How often\r\nhave I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible\r\nwhatever remains, HOWEVER IMPROBABLE, must be the truth?  We know that\r\nhe did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney.  We also\r\nknow that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no\r\nconcealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?\"\r\n\r\n\"He came through the hole in the roof,\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did.  He must have done so. If you will have the kindness\r\nto hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches to the room\r\nabove,--the secret room in which the treasure was found.\"\r\n\r\nHe mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he swung\r\nhimself up into the garret.  Then, lying on his face, he reached down\r\nfor the lamp and held it while I followed him.\r\n\r\nThe chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and\r\nsix the other.  The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin\r\nlath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from beam\r\nto beam.  The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner shell\r\nof the true roof of the house.  There was no furniture of any sort, and\r\nthe accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, you see,\" said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand against\r\nthe sloping wall.  \"This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof.\r\nI can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping at a gentle\r\nangle.  This, then, is the way by which Number One entered.  Let us see\r\nif we can find any other traces of his individuality.\"\r\n\r\nHe held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the\r\nsecond time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.\r\nFor myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.\r\nThe floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot,--clear,\r\nwell defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the size of those of an\r\nordinary man.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I said, in a whisper, \"a child has done the horrid thing.\"\r\n\r\nHe had recovered his self-possession in an instant.  \"I was staggered\r\nfor the moment,\" he said, \"but the thing is quite natural.  My memory\r\nfailed me, or I should have been able to foretell it.  There is nothing\r\nmore to be learned here.  Let us go down.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?\" I asked, eagerly,\r\nwhen we had regained the lower room once more.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself,\" said he, with a touch\r\nof impatience.  \"You know my methods.  Apply them, and it will be\r\ninstructive to compare results.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"It will be clear enough to you soon,\" he said, in an off-hand way.  \"I\r\nthink that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will look.\"\r\nHe whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about the room\r\non his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long thin nose\r\nonly a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes gleaming and\r\ndeep-set like those of a bird.  So swift, silent, and furtive were his\r\nmovements, like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent,\r\nthat I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made\r\nhad he turned his energy and sagacity against the law, instead of\r\nexerting them in its defense.  As he hunted about, he kept muttering to\r\nhimself, and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight.\r\n\r\n\"We are certainly in luck,\" said he.  \"We ought to have very little\r\ntrouble now.  Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the\r\ncreosote.  You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here\r\nat the side of this evil-smelling mess.  The carboy has been cracked,\r\nYou see, and the stuff has leaked out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we have got him, that's all,\" said he.  \"I know a dog that would\r\nfollow that scent to the world's end.  If a pack can track a trailed\r\nherring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow so\r\npungent a smell as this?  It sounds like a sum in the rule of three.\r\nThe answer should give us the--But halloo! here are the accredited\r\nrepresentatives of the law.\"\r\n\r\nHeavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below, and\r\nthe hall door shut with a loud crash.\r\n\r\n\"Before they come,\" said Holmes, \"just put your hand here on this poor\r\nfellow's arm, and here on his leg.  What do you feel?\"\r\n\r\n\"The muscles are as hard as a board,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding\r\nthe usual rigor mortis.  Coupled with this distortion of the face, this\r\nHippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers called it,\r\nwhat conclusion would it suggest to your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid,\" I answered,--\"some\r\nstrychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn\r\nmuscles of the face.  On getting into the room I at once looked for the\r\nmeans by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I\r\ndiscovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force\r\ninto the scalp.  You observe that the part struck was that which would\r\nbe turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his\r\nchair.  Now examine the thorn.\"\r\n\r\nI took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was\r\nlong, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though\r\nsome gummy substance had dried upon it.  The blunt end had been trimmed\r\nand rounded off with a knife.\r\n\r\n\"Is that an English thorn?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No, it certainly is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.\r\nBut here are the regulars:  so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on\r\nthe passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode heavily\r\ninto the room.  He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a pair of\r\nvery small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen\r\nand puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform,\r\nand by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.\r\n\r\n\"Here's a business!\" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. \"Here's a\r\npretty business!  But who are all these?  Why, the house seems to be as\r\nfull as a rabbit-warren!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones,\" said Holmes,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course I do!\" he wheezed.  \"It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the\r\ntheorist.  Remember you!  I'll never forget how you lectured us all on\r\ncauses and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case.  It's\r\ntrue you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was more\r\nby good luck than good guidance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a piece of very simple reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, come, now, come!  Never be ashamed to own up.  But what is all\r\nthis?  Bad business!  Bad business!  Stern facts here,--no room for\r\ntheories.  How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another\r\ncase!  I was at the station when the message arrived.  What d'you think\r\nthe man died of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over,\" said Holmes, dryly.\r\n\r\n\"No, no.  Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head\r\nsometimes.  Dear me!  Door locked, I understand.  Jewels worth half a\r\nmillion missing.  How was the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fastened; but there are steps on the sill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do with\r\nthe matter.  That's common sense.  Man might have died in a fit; but\r\nthen the jewels are missing.  Ha!  I have a theory. These flashes come\r\nupon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr. Sholto.\r\nYour friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes?  Sholto\r\nwas, on his own confession, with his brother last night.  The brother\r\ndied in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure.  How's\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on\r\nthe inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum!  There's a flaw there.  Let us apply common sense to the matter.\r\nThis Thaddeus Sholto WAS with his brother; there WAS a quarrel; so much\r\nwe know.  The brother is dead and the jewels are gone.  So much also we\r\nknow.  No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him.  His bed\r\nhad not been slept in.  Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state\r\nof mind.  His appearance is--well, not attractive.  You see that I am\r\nweaving my web round Thaddeus.  The net begins to close upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not quite in possession of the facts yet,\" said Holmes. \"This\r\nsplinter of wood, which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned,\r\nwas in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this card,\r\ninscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay this\r\nrather curious stone-headed instrument.  How does all that fit into\r\nyour theory?\"\r\n\r\n\"Confirms it in every respect,\" said the fat detective, pompously.\r\n\"House is full of Indian curiosities.  Thaddeus brought this up, and if\r\nthis splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use\r\nof it as any other man.  The card is some hocus-pocus,--a blind, as\r\nlike as not.  The only question is, how did he depart?  Ah, of course,\r\nhere is a hole in the roof.\"  With great activity, considering his\r\nbulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret, and\r\nimmediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he\r\nhad found the trap-door.\r\n\r\n\"He can find something,\" remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.  \"He\r\nhas occasional glimmerings of reason.  _Il n'y a pas des sots si\r\nincommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!_\"\r\n\r\n\"You see!\" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.\r\n\"Facts are better than mere theories, after all.  My view of the case\r\nis confirmed.  There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and it\r\nis partly open.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was I who opened it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, indeed!  You did notice it, then?\"  He seemed a little crestfallen\r\nat the discovery.  \"Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our\r\ngentleman got away.  Inspector!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" from the passage.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to inform\r\nyou that anything which you may say will be used against you.  I arrest\r\nyou in the queen's name as being concerned in the death of your\r\nbrother.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, now!  Didn't I tell you!\" cried the poor little man, throwing\r\nout his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto,\" said Holmes.  \"I think\r\nthat I can engage to clear you of the charge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!\"\r\nsnapped the detective.  \"You may find it a harder matter than you\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free\r\npresent of the name and description of one of the two people who were\r\nin this room last night.  His name, I have every reason to believe, is\r\nJonathan Small.  He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his\r\nright leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the\r\ninner side.  His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an iron\r\nband round the heel.  He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned, and has\r\nbeen a convict.  These few indications may be of some assistance to\r\nyou, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing\r\nfrom the palm of his hand.  The other man--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! the other man--?\" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but\r\nimpressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of the\r\nother's manner.\r\n\r\n\"Is a rather curious person,\" said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his\r\nheel.  \"I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair\r\nof them.--A word with you, Watson.\"\r\n\r\nHe led me out to the head of the stair.  \"This unexpected occurrence,\"\r\nhe said, \"has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of\r\nour journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have just been thinking so,\" I answered.  \"It is not right that Miss\r\nMorstan should remain in this stricken house.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  You must escort her home.  She lives with Mrs. Cecil Forrester,\r\nin Lower Camberwell:  so it is not very far.  I will wait for you here\r\nif you will drive out again.  Or perhaps you are too tired?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means.  I don't think I could rest until I know more of this\r\nfantastic business.  I have seen something of the rough side of life,\r\nbut I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises\r\nto-night has shaken my nerve completely.  I should like, however, to\r\nsee the matter through with you, now that I have got so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your presence will be of great service to me,\" he answered.  \"We shall\r\nwork the case out independently, and leave this fellow Jones to exult\r\nover any mare's-nest which he may choose to construct.  When you have\r\ndropped Miss Morstan I wish you to go on to No. 3 Pinchin Lane, down\r\nnear the water's edge at Lambeth. The third house on the right-hand\r\nside is a bird-stuffer's: Sherman is the name.  You will see a weasel\r\nholding a young rabbit in the window.  Knock old Sherman up, and tell\r\nhim, with my compliments, that I want Toby at once.  You will bring\r\nToby back in the cab with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dog, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,--a queer mongrel, with a most amazing power of scent.  I would\r\nrather have Toby's help than that of the whole detective force of\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall bring him, then,\" said I.  \"It is one now.  I ought to be back\r\nbefore three, if I can get a fresh horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Holmes, \"shall see what I can learn from Mrs. Bernstone,\r\nand from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me, sleeps in the\r\nnext garret.  Then I shall study the great Jones's methods and listen\r\nto his not too delicate sarcasms. 'Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen\r\nverhoehnen was sie nicht verstehen.'  Goethe is always pithy.\"\r\n\nThe police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss\r\nMorstan back to her home.  After the angelic fashion of women, she had\r\nborne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker\r\nthan herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the\r\nside of the frightened housekeeper.  In the cab, however, she first\r\nturned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely had\r\nshe been tried by the adventures of the night.  She has told me since\r\nthat she thought me cold and distant upon that journey.  She little\r\nguessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of self-restraint\r\nwhich held me back.  My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as\r\nmy hand had in the garden.  I felt that years of the conventionalities\r\nof life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this\r\none day of strange experiences.  Yet there were two thoughts which\r\nsealed the words of affection upon my lips.  She was weak and helpless,\r\nshaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to\r\nobtrude love upon her at such a time.  Worse still, she was rich.  If\r\nHolmes's researches were successful, she would be an heiress.  Was it\r\nfair, was it honorable, that a half-pay surgeon should take such\r\nadvantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about?  Might she not\r\nlook upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker?  I could not bear to risk\r\nthat such a thought should cross her mind.  This Agra treasure\r\nintervened like an impassable barrier between us.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two o'clock when we reached Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The\r\nservants had retired hours ago, but Mrs. Forrester had been so\r\ninterested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that\r\nshe had sat up in the hope of her return.  She opened the door herself,\r\na middle-aged, graceful woman, and it gave me joy to see how tenderly\r\nher arm stole round the other's waist and how motherly was the voice in\r\nwhich she greeted her. She was clearly no mere paid dependant, but an\r\nhonored friend.  I was introduced, and Mrs. Forrester earnestly begged\r\nme to step in and tell her our adventures.  I explained, however, the\r\nimportance of my errand, and promised faithfully to call and report any\r\nprogress which we might make with the case.  As we drove away I stole a\r\nglance back, and I still seem to see that little group on the step, the\r\ntwo graceful, clinging figures, the half-opened door, the hall light\r\nshining through stained glass, the barometer, and the bright\r\nstair-rods.  It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a\r\ntranquil English home in the midst of the wild, dark business which had\r\nabsorbed us.\r\n\r\nAnd the more I thought of what had happened, the wilder and darker it\r\ngrew.  I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I\r\nrattled on through the silent gas-lit streets.  There was the original\r\nproblem:  that at least was pretty clear now. The death of Captain\r\nMorstan, the sending of the pearls, the advertisement, the letter,--we\r\nhad had light upon all those events.  They had only led us, however, to\r\na deeper and far more tragic mystery.  The Indian treasure, the curious\r\nplan found among Morstan's baggage, the strange scene at Major Sholto's\r\ndeath, the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the\r\nmurder of the discoverer, the very singular accompaniments to the\r\ncrime, the footsteps, the remarkable weapons, the words upon the card,\r\ncorresponding with those upon Captain Morstan's chart,--here was indeed\r\na labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my\r\nfellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue.\r\n\r\nPinchin Lane was a row of shabby two-storied brick houses in the lower\r\nquarter of Lambeth.  I had to knock for some time at No. 3 before I\r\ncould make my impression.  At last, however, there was the glint of a\r\ncandle behind the blind, and a face looked out at the upper window.\r\n\r\n\"Go on, you drunken vagabone,\" said the face.  \"If you kick up any more\r\nrow I'll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll let one out it's just what I have come for,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Go on!\" yelled the voice.  \"So help me gracious, I have a wiper in the\r\nbag, an' I'll drop it on your 'ead if you don't hook it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want a dog,\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"I won't be argued with!\" shouted Mr. Sherman.  \"Now stand clear, for\r\nwhen I say 'three,' down goes the wiper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sherlock Holmes--\" I began, but the words had a most magical\r\neffect, for the window instantly slammed down, and within a minute the\r\ndoor was unbarred and open.  Mr. Sherman was a lanky, lean old man,\r\nwith stooping shoulders, a stringy neck, and blue-tinted glasses.\r\n\r\n\"A friend of Mr. Sherlock is always welcome,\" said he.  \"Step in, sir.\r\nKeep clear of the badger; for he bites.  Ah, naughty, naughty, would\r\nyou take a nip at the gentleman?\"  This to a stoat which thrust its\r\nwicked head and red eyes between the bars of its cage.  \"Don't mind\r\nthat, sir:  it's only a slow-worm.  It hain't got no fangs, so I gives\r\nit the run o' the room, for it keeps the beetles down.  You must not\r\nmind my bein' just a little short wi' you at first, for I'm guyed at by\r\nthe children, and there's many a one just comes down this lane to knock\r\nme up.  What was it that Mr. Sherlock Holmes wanted, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"He wanted a dog of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that would be Toby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Toby was the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toby lives at No. 7 on the left here.\"  He moved slowly forward with\r\nhis candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round\r\nhim.  In the uncertain, shadowy light I could see dimly that there were\r\nglancing, glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and\r\ncorner.  Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls,\r\nwho lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices\r\ndisturbed their slumbers.\r\n\r\nToby proved to be an ugly, long-haired, lop-eared creature, half spaniel\r\nand half lurcher, brown-and-white in color, with a very clumsy waddling\r\ngait.  It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old\r\nnaturalist handed to me, and, having thus sealed an alliance, it\r\nfollowed me to the cab, and made no difficulties about accompanying me.\r\nIt had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back\r\nonce more at Pondicherry Lodge.  The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had, I\r\nfound, been arrested as an accessory, and both he and Mr. Sholto had\r\nbeen marched off to the station.  Two constables guarded the narrow\r\ngate, but they allowed me to pass with the dog on my mentioning the\r\ndetective's name.\r\n\r\nHolmes was standing on the door-step, with his hands in his pockets,\r\nsmoking his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have him there!\" said he.  \"Good dog, then!  Atheney Jones has\r\ngone.  We have had an immense display of energy since you left.  He has\r\narrested not only friend Thaddeus, but the gatekeeper, the housekeeper,\r\nand the Indian servant.  We have the place to ourselves, but for a\r\nsergeant up-stairs.  Leave the dog here, and come up.\"\r\n\r\nWe tied Toby to the hall table, and reascended the stairs.  The room\r\nwas as he had left it, save that a sheet had been draped over the\r\ncentral figure.  A weary-looking police-sergeant reclined in the corner.\r\n\r\n\"Lend me your bull's-eye, sergeant,\" said my companion.  \"Now tie this\r\nbit of card round my neck, so as to hang it in front of me. Thank you.\r\nNow I must kick off my boots and stockings.--Just you carry them down\r\nwith you, Watson.  I am going to do a little climbing.  And dip my\r\nhandkerchief into the creasote.  That will do.  Now come up into the\r\ngarret with me for a moment.\"\r\n\r\nWe clambered up through the hole.  Holmes turned his light once more\r\nupon the footsteps in the dust.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks,\" he said. \"Do you\r\nobserve anything noteworthy about them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They belong,\" I said, \"to a child or a small woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Apart from their size, though.  Is there nothing else?\"\r\n\r\n\"They appear to be much as other footmarks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  Look here!  This is the print of a right foot in the\r\ndust.  Now I make one with my naked foot beside it.  What is the chief\r\ndifference?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your toes are all cramped together.  The other print has each toe\r\ndistinctly divided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  That is the point.  Bear that in mind.  Now, would you\r\nkindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the\r\nwood-work?  I shall stay here, as I have this handkerchief in my hand.\"\r\n\r\nI did as he directed, and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\n\"That is where he put his foot in getting out.  If YOU can trace him, I\r\nshould think that Toby will have no difficulty.  Now run down-stairs,\r\nloose the dog, and look out for Blondin.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the\r\nroof, and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very\r\nslowly along the ridge.  I lost sight of him behind a stack of\r\nchimneys, but he presently reappeared, and then vanished once more upon\r\nthe opposite side.  When I made my way round there I found him seated\r\nat one of the corner eaves.\r\n\r\n\"That you, Watson?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the place.  What is that black thing down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"A water-barrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Top on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"No sign of a ladder?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Confound the fellow!  It's a most break-neck place.  I ought to be\r\nable to come down where he could climb up.  The water-pipe feels pretty\r\nfirm.  Here goes, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a scuffling of feet, and the lantern began to come steadily\r\ndown the side of the wall.  Then with a light spring he came on to the\r\nbarrel, and from there to the earth.\r\n\r\n\"It was easy to follow him,\" he said, drawing on his stockings and\r\nboots.  \"Tiles were loosened the whole way along, and in his hurry he\r\nhad dropped this.  It confirms my diagnosis, as you doctors express it.\"\r\n\r\nThe object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out\r\nof colored grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it.  In\r\nshape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case. Inside were half a\r\ndozen spines of dark wood, sharp at one end and rounded at the other,\r\nlike that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto.\r\n\r\n\"They are hellish things,\" said he.  \"Look out that you don't prick\r\nyourself.  I'm delighted to have them, for the chances are that they\r\nare all he has.  There is the less fear of you or me finding one in our\r\nskin before long.  I would sooner face a Martini bullet, myself.  Are\r\nyou game for a six-mile trudge, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"Your leg will stand it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, doggy!  Good old Toby!  Smell it, Toby, smell it!\" He\r\npushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog's nose, while the\r\ncreature stood with its fluffy legs separated, and with a most comical\r\ncock to its head, like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous\r\nvintage.  Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance, fastened a\r\nstout cord to the mongrel's collar, and led him to the foot of the\r\nwater-barrel.  The creature instantly broke into a succession of high,\r\ntremulous yelps, and, with his nose on the ground, and his tail in the\r\nair, pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and\r\nkept us at the top of our speed.\r\n\r\nThe east had been gradually whitening, and we could now see some\r\ndistance in the cold gray light.  The square, massive house, with its\r\nblack, empty windows and high, bare walls, towered up, sad and forlorn,\r\nbehind us.  Our course led right across the grounds, in and out among\r\nthe trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected.\r\nThe whole place, with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs,\r\nhad a blighted, ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy\r\nwhich hung over it.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along, whining eagerly,\r\nunderneath its shadow, and stopped finally in a corner screened by a\r\nyoung beech.  Where the two walls joined, several bricks had been\r\nloosened, and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the\r\nlower side, as though they had frequently been used as a ladder.\r\nHolmes clambered up, and, taking the dog from me, he dropped it over\r\nupon the other side.\r\n\r\n\"There's the print of wooden-leg's hand,\" he remarked, as I mounted up\r\nbeside him.  \"You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white\r\nplaster.  What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain\r\nsince yesterday!  The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their\r\neight-and-twenty hours' start.\"\r\n\r\nI confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great\r\ntraffic which had passed along the London road in the interval.  My\r\nfears were soon appeased, however.  Toby never hesitated or swerved,\r\nbut waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion.  Clearly, the pungent\r\nsmell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents.\r\n\r\n\"Do not imagine,\" said Holmes, \"that I depend for my success in this\r\ncase upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot\r\nin the chemical.  I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace\r\nthem in many different ways.  This, however, is the readiest and, since\r\nfortune has put it into our hands, I should be culpable if I neglected\r\nit.  It has, however, prevented the case from becoming the pretty\r\nlittle intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be. There\r\nmight have been some credit to be gained out of it, but for this too\r\npalpable clue.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is credit, and to spare,\" said I.  \"I assure you, Holmes, that I\r\nmarvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case, even\r\nmore than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder. The thing seems to me to\r\nbe deeper and more inexplicable.  How, for example, could you describe\r\nwith such confidence the wooden-legged man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, my dear boy! it was simplicity itself.  I don't wish to be\r\ntheatrical.  It is all patent and above-board.  Two officers who are in\r\ncommand of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried\r\ntreasure.  A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan\r\nSmall.  You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain\r\nMorstan's possession.  He had signed it in behalf of himself and his\r\nassociates,--the sign of the four, as he somewhat dramatically called\r\nit.  Aided by this chart, the officers--or one of them--gets the\r\ntreasure and brings it to England, leaving, we will suppose, some\r\ncondition under which he received it unfulfilled.  Now, then, why did\r\nnot Jonathan Small get the treasure himself?  The answer is obvious.\r\nThe chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close\r\nassociation with convicts.  Jonathan Small did not get the treasure\r\nbecause he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not\r\nget away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is mere speculation,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"It is more than that.  It is the only hypothesis which covers the\r\nfacts.  Let us see how it fits in with the sequel.  Major Sholto\r\nremains at peace for some years, happy in the possession of his\r\ntreasure.  Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great\r\nfright.  What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or had escaped.  That is much more likely, for he would have known\r\nwhat their term of imprisonment was.  It would not have been a surprise\r\nto him.  What does he do then?  He guards himself against a\r\nwooden-legged man,--a white man, mark you, for he mistakes a white\r\ntradesman for him, and actually fires a pistol at him.  Now, only one\r\nwhite man's name is on the chart.  The others are Hindoos or\r\nMohammedans.  There is no other white man. Therefore we may say with\r\nconfidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small.\r\nDoes the reasoning strike you as being faulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"No:  it is clear and concise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small. Let us\r\nlook at it from his point of view.  He comes to England with the double\r\nidea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having\r\nhis revenge upon the man who had wronged him.  He found out where\r\nSholto lived, and very possibly he established communications with some\r\none inside the house.  There is this butler, Lal Rao, whom we have not\r\nseen.  Mrs. Bernstone gives him far from a good character. Small could\r\nnot find out, however, where the treasure was hid, for no one ever\r\nknew, save the major and one faithful servant who had died.  Suddenly\r\nSmall learns that the major is on his death-bed.  In a frenzy lest the\r\nsecret of the treasure die with him, he runs the gauntlet of the\r\nguards, makes his way to the dying man's window, and is only deterred\r\nfrom entering by the presence of his two sons.  Mad with hate, however,\r\nagainst the dead man, he enters the room that night, searches his\r\nprivate papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to\r\nthe treasure, and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short\r\ninscription upon the card.  He had doubtless planned beforehand that\r\nshould he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body\r\nas a sign that it was not a common murder, but, from the point of view\r\nof the four associates, something in the nature of an act of justice.\r\nWhimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the\r\nannals of crime, and usually afford valuable indications as to the\r\ncriminal.  Do you follow all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very clearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, what could Jonathan Small do?  He could only continue to keep a\r\nsecret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure. Possibly he\r\nleaves England and only comes back at intervals. Then comes the\r\ndiscovery of the garret, and he is instantly informed of it.  We again\r\ntrace the presence of some confederate in the household.  Jonathan,\r\nwith his wooden leg, is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of\r\nBartholomew Sholto.  He takes with him, however, a rather curious\r\nassociate, who gets over this difficulty, but dips his naked foot into\r\ncreasote, whence comes Toby, and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer\r\nwith a damaged tendo Achillis.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was the associate, and not Jonathan, who committed the crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  And rather to Jonathan's disgust, to judge by the way he\r\nstamped about when he got into the room.  He bore no grudge against\r\nBartholomew Sholto, and would have preferred if he could have been\r\nsimply bound and gagged.  He did not wish to put his head in a halter.\r\nThere was no help for it, however:  the savage instincts of his\r\ncompanion had broken out, and the poison had done its work:  so\r\nJonathan Small left his record, lowered the treasure-box to the ground,\r\nand followed it himself.  That was the train of events as far as I can\r\ndecipher them.  Of course as to his personal appearance he must be\r\nmiddle-aged, and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an\r\noven as the Andamans. His height is readily calculated from the length\r\nof his stride, and we know that he was bearded.  His hairiness was the\r\none point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him\r\nat the window.  I don't know that there is anything else.\"\r\n\r\n\"The associate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, well, there is no great mystery in that.  But you will know all\r\nabout it soon enough.  How sweet the morning air is!  See how that one\r\nlittle cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo.\r\nNow the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank.\r\nIt shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a\r\nstranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty\r\nambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces\r\nof nature!  Are you well up in your Jean Paul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fairly so.  I worked back to him through Carlyle.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was like following the brook to the parent lake.  He makes one\r\ncurious but profound remark.  It is that the chief proof of man's real\r\ngreatness lies in his perception of his own smallness. It argues, you\r\nsee, a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a\r\nproof of nobility.  There is much food for thought in Richter.  You\r\nhave not a pistol, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my stick.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get\r\nto their lair.  Jonathan I shall leave to you, but if the other turns\r\nnasty I shall shoot him dead.\"  He took out his revolver as he spoke,\r\nand, having loaded two of the chambers, he put it back into the\r\nright-hand pocket of his jacket.\r\n\r\nWe had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the\r\nhalf-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis. Now,\r\nhowever, we were beginning to come among continuous streets, where\r\nlaborers and dockmen were already astir, and slatternly women were\r\ntaking down shutters and brushing door-steps.  At the square-topped\r\ncorner public houses business was just beginning, and rough-looking men\r\nwere emerging, rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their\r\nmorning wet.  Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as\r\nwe passed, but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to\r\nthe left, but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an\r\noccasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent.\r\n\r\nWe had traversed Streatham, Brixton, Camberwell, and now found\r\nourselves in Kennington Lane, having borne away through the\r\nside-streets to the east of the Oval.  The men whom we pursued seemed\r\nto have taken a curiously zigzag road, with the idea probably of\r\nescaping observation.  They had never kept to the main road if a\r\nparallel side-street would serve their turn.  At the foot of Kennington\r\nLane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles\r\nStreet.  Where the latter street turns into Knight's Place, Toby ceased\r\nto advance, but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked\r\nand the other drooping, the very picture of canine indecision.  Then he\r\nwaddled round in circles, looking up to us from time to time, as if to\r\nask for sympathy in his embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce is the matter with the dog?\" growled Holmes. \"They\r\nsurely would not take a cab, or go off in a balloon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they stood here for some time,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it's all right.  He's off again,\" said my companion, in a tone of\r\nrelief.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed off, for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up\r\nhis mind, and darted away with an energy and determination such as he\r\nhad not yet shown.  The scent appeared to be much hotter than before,\r\nfor he had not even to put his nose on the ground, but tugged at his\r\nleash and tried to break into a run.  I cold see by the gleam in\r\nHolmes's eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey.\r\n\r\nOur course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and\r\nNelson's large timber-yard, just past the White Eagle tavern. Here the\r\ndog, frantic with excitement, turned down through the side-gate into\r\nthe enclosure, where the sawyers were already at work.  On the dog\r\nraced through sawdust and shavings, down an alley, round a passage,\r\nbetween two wood-piles, and finally, with a triumphant yelp, sprang\r\nupon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it\r\nhad been brought.  With lolling tongue and blinking eyes, Toby stood\r\nupon the cask, looking from one to the other of us for some sign of\r\nappreciation.  The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley\r\nwere smeared with a dark liquid, and the whole air was heavy with the\r\nsmell of creasote.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other, and then burst\r\nsimultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.\r\n\n\"What now?\" I asked.  \"Toby has lost his character for infallibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"He acted according to his lights,\" said Holmes, lifting him down from\r\nthe barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard.  \"If you consider\r\nhow much creasote is carted about London in one day, it is no great\r\nwonder that our trail should have been crossed.  It is much used now,\r\nespecially for the seasoning of wood.  Poor Toby is not to blame.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must get on the main scent again, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  And, fortunately, we have no distance to go.  Evidently what\r\npuzzled the dog at the corner of Knight's Place was that there were two\r\ndifferent trails running in opposite directions. We took the wrong one.\r\nIt only remains to follow the other.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no difficulty about this.  On leading Toby to the place where\r\nhe had committed his fault, he cast about in a wide circle and finally\r\ndashed off in a fresh direction.\r\n\r\n\"We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the\r\ncreasote-barrel came from,\" I observed.\r\n\r\n\"I had thought of that.  But you notice that he keeps on the pavement,\r\nwhereas the barrel passed down the roadway.  No, we are on the true\r\nscent now.\"\r\n\r\nIt tended down towards the river-side, running through Belmont Place\r\nand Prince's Street.  At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to\r\nthe water's edge, where there was a small wooden wharf.  Toby led us to\r\nthe very edge of this, and there stood whining, looking out on the dark\r\ncurrent beyond.\r\n\r\n\"We are out of luck,\" said Holmes.  \"They have taken to a boat here.\"\r\nSeveral small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the\r\nedge of the wharf.  We took Toby round to each in turn, but, though he\r\nsniffed earnestly, he made no sign.\r\n\r\nClose to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden\r\nplacard slung out through the second window.  \"Mordecai Smith\" was\r\nprinted across it in large letters, and, underneath, \"Boats to hire by\r\nthe hour or day.\"  A second inscription above the door informed us that\r\na steam launch was kept,--a statement which was confirmed by a great\r\npile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and\r\nhis face assumed an ominous expression.\r\n\r\n\"This looks bad,\" said he.  \"These fellows are sharper than I expected.\r\nThey seem to have covered their tracks.  There has, I fear, been\r\npreconcerted management here.\"\r\n\r\nHe was approaching the door of the house, when it opened, and a little,\r\ncurly-headed lad of six came running out, followed by a stoutish,\r\nred-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"You come back and be washed, Jack,\" she shouted.  \"Come back, you\r\nyoung imp; for if your father comes home and finds you like that, he'll\r\nlet us hear of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear little chap!\" said Holmes, strategically.  \"What a rosy-cheeked\r\nyoung rascal!  Now, Jack, is there anything you would like?\"\r\n\r\nThe youth pondered for a moment.  \"I'd like a shillin',\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing you would like better?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like two shillin' better,\" the prodigy answered, after some\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are, then!  Catch!--A fine child, Mrs. Smith!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lor' bless you, sir, he is that, and forward.  He gets a'most too much\r\nfor me to manage, 'specially when my man is away days at a time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away, is he?\" said Holmes, in a disappointed voice.  \"I am sorry for\r\nthat, for I wanted to speak to Mr. Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's been away since yesterday mornin', sir, and, truth to tell, I am\r\nbeginnin' to feel frightened about him.  But if it was about a boat,\r\nsir, maybe I could serve as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wanted to hire his steam launch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, bless you, sir, it is in the steam launch that he has gone.\r\nThat's what puzzles me; for I know there ain't more coals in her than\r\nwould take her to about Woolwich and back.  If he'd been away in the\r\nbarge I'd ha' thought nothin'; for many a time a job has taken him as\r\nfar as Gravesend, and then if there was much doin' there he might ha'\r\nstayed over.  But what good is a steam launch without coals?\"\r\n\r\n\"He might have bought some at a wharf down the river.\"\r\n\r\n\"He might, sir, but it weren't his way.  Many a time I've heard him\r\ncall out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags. Besides, I don't\r\nlike that wooden-legged man, wi' his ugly face and outlandish talk.\r\nWhat did he want always knockin' about here for?\"\r\n\r\n\"A wooden-legged man?\" said Holmes, with bland surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, a brown, monkey-faced chap that's called more'n once for my\r\nold man.  It was him that roused him up yesternight, and, what's more,\r\nmy man knew he was comin', for he had steam up in the launch.  I tell\r\nyou straight, sir, I don't feel easy in my mind about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, my dear Mrs. Smith,\" said Holmes, shrugging his shoulders, \"You\r\nare frightening yourself about nothing.  How could you possibly tell\r\nthat it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night?  I don't quite\r\nunderstand how you can be so sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"His voice, sir.  I knew his voice, which is kind o' thick and foggy.\r\nHe tapped at the winder,--about three it would be.  'Show a leg,\r\nmatey,' says he:  'time to turn out guard.'  My old man woke up\r\nJim,--that's my eldest,--and away they went, without so much as a word\r\nto me.  I could hear the wooden leg clackin' on the stones.\"\r\n\r\n\"And was this wooden-legged man alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't say, I am sure, sir.  I didn't hear no one else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, Mrs. Smith, for I wanted a steam launch, and I have heard\r\ngood reports of the--Let me see, what is her name?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Aurora, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!  She's not that old green launch with a yellow line, very broad in\r\nthe beam?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed.  She's as trim a little thing as any on the river. She's\r\nbeen fresh painted, black with two red streaks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks.  I hope that you will hear soon from Mr. Smith.  I am going\r\ndown the river; and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let\r\nhim know that you are uneasy.  A black funnel, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.  Black with a white band.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, of course.  It was the sides which were black. Good-morning, Mrs.\r\nSmith.--There is a boatman here with a wherry, Watson.  We shall take\r\nit and cross the river.\r\n\r\n\"The main thing with people of that sort,\" said Holmes, as we sat in\r\nthe sheets of the wherry, \"is never to let them think that their\r\ninformation can be of the slightest importance to you.  If you do, they\r\nwill instantly shut up like an oyster.  If you listen to them under\r\nprotest, as it were, you are very likely to get what you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our course now seems pretty clear,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"What would you do, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the\r\nAurora.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, it would be a colossal task.  She may have touched at\r\nany wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich.\r\nBelow the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for\r\nmiles.  It would take you days and days to exhaust them, if you set\r\nabout it alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Employ the police, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment. He is\r\nnot a bad fellow, and I should not like to do anything which would\r\ninjure him professionally.  But I have a fancy for working it out\r\nmyself, now that we have gone so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we advertise, then, asking for information from wharfingers?\"\r\n\r\n\"Worse and worse!  Our men would know that the chase was hot at their\r\nheels, and they would be off out of the country.  As it is, they are\r\nlikely enough to leave, but as long as they think they are perfectly\r\nsafe they will be in no hurry.  Jones's energy will be of use to us\r\nthere, for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily\r\npress, and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong\r\nscent.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are we to do, then?\" I asked, as we landed near Millbank\r\nPenitentiary.\r\n\r\n\"Take this hansom, drive home, have some breakfast, and get an hour's\r\nsleep.  It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again.\r\nStop at a telegraph-office, cabby!  We will keep Toby, for he may be of\r\nuse to us yet.\"\r\n\r\nWe pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office, and Holmes\r\ndespatched his wire.  \"Whom do you think that is to?\" he asked, as we\r\nresumed our journey.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force\r\nwhom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"This is just the case where they might be invaluable.  If they fail, I\r\nhave other resources; but I shall try them first.  That wire was to my\r\ndirty little lieutenant, Wiggins, and I expect that he and his gang\r\nwill be with us before we have finished our breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nIt was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a\r\nstrong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was\r\nlimp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body.  I had not the\r\nprofessional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look\r\nat the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem.  As far as the\r\ndeath of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him, and\r\ncould feel no intense antipathy to his murderers.  The treasure,\r\nhowever, was a different matter.  That, or part of it, belonged\r\nrightfully to Miss Morstan.  While there was a chance of recovering it\r\nI was ready to devote my life to the one object.  True, if I found it\r\nit would probably put her forever beyond my reach.  Yet it would be a\r\npetty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as\r\nthat.  If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold\r\nstronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.\r\n\r\nA bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up\r\nwonderfully.  When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid\r\nand Homes pouring out the coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is,\" said he, laughing, and pointing to an open newspaper.\r\n\"The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up\r\nbetween them.  But you have had enough of the case. Better have your\r\nham and eggs first.\"\r\n\r\nI took the paper from him and read the short notice, which was headed\r\n\"Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood.\"\r\n\r\n\"About twelve o'clock last night,\" said the Standard, \"Mr. Bartholomew\r\nSholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room\r\nunder circumstances which point to foul play.  As far as we can learn,\r\nno actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a\r\nvaluable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had\r\ninherited from his father has been carried off.  The discovery was\r\nfirst made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the\r\nhouse with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased.  By a singular\r\npiece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the\r\ndetective police force, happened to be at the Norwood Police Station,\r\nand was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm.  His\r\ntrained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the\r\ndetection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the\r\nbrother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the\r\nhousekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a\r\nporter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo.  It is quite certain that the\r\nthief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's\r\nwell-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation\r\nhave enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not\r\nhave entered by the door or by the window, but must have made their way\r\nacross the roof of the building, and so through a trap-door into a room\r\nwhich communicated with that in which the body was found.  This fact,\r\nwhich has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was\r\nno mere haphazard burglary.  The prompt and energetic action of the\r\nofficers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such\r\noccasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind.  We cannot but think\r\nthat it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our\r\ndetectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more\r\neffective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it gorgeous!\" said Holmes, grinning over his coffee-cup. \"What\r\ndo you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for\r\nthe crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I.  I wouldn't answer for our safety now, if he should happen to\r\nhave another of his attacks of energy.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a loud ring at the bell, and I could hear Mrs.\r\nHudson, our landlady, raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\"By heaven, Holmes,\" I said, half rising, \"I believe that they are\r\nreally after us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it's not quite so bad as that.  It is the unofficial force,--the\r\nBaker Street irregulars.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the\r\nstairs, a clatter of high voices, and in rushed a dozen dirty and\r\nragged little street-Arabs.  There was some show of discipline among\r\nthem, despite their tumultuous entry, for they instantly drew up in\r\nline and stood facing us with expectant faces.  One of their number,\r\ntaller and older than the others, stood forward with an air of lounging\r\nsuperiority which was very funny in such a disreputable little\r\nscarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Got your message, sir,\" said he, \"and brought 'em on sharp. Three bob\r\nand a tanner for tickets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here you are,\" said Holmes, producing some silver.  \"In future they\r\ncan report to you, Wiggins, and you to me.  I cannot have the house\r\ninvaded in this way.  However, it is just as well that you should all\r\nhear the instructions.  I want to find the whereabouts of a steam\r\nlaunch called the Aurora, owner Mordecai Smith, black with two red\r\nstreaks, funnel black with a white band.  She is down the river\r\nsomewhere.  I want one boy to be at Mordecai Smith's landing-stage\r\nopposite Millbank to say if the boat comes back.  You must divide it\r\nout among yourselves, and do both banks thoroughly.  Let me know the\r\nmoment you have news.  Is that all clear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, guv'nor,\" said Wiggins.\r\n\r\n\"The old scale of pay, and a guinea to the boy who finds the boat.\r\nHere's a day in advance.  Now off you go!\"  He handed them a shilling\r\neach, and away they buzzed down the stairs, and I saw them a moment\r\nlater streaming down the street.\r\n\r\n\"If the launch is above water they will find her,\" said Holmes, as he\r\nrose from the table and lit his pipe.  \"They can go everywhere, see\r\neverything, overhear every one.  I expect to hear before evening that\r\nthey have spotted her.  In the mean while, we can do nothing but await\r\nresults.  We cannot pick up the broken trail until we find either the\r\nAurora or Mr. Mordecai Smith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Toby could eat these scraps, I dare say.  Are you going to bed,\r\nHolmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No:  I am not tired.  I have a curious constitution.  I never remember\r\nfeeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely.  I am\r\ngoing to smoke and to think over this queer business to which my fair\r\nclient has introduced us.  If ever man had an easy task, this of ours\r\nought to be.  Wooden-legged men are not so common, but the other man\r\nmust, I should think, be absolutely unique.\"\r\n\r\n\"That other man again!\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no wish to make a mystery of him,--to you, anyway.  But you\r\nmust have formed your own opinion.  Now, do consider the data.\r\nDiminutive footmarks, toes never fettered by boots, naked feet,\r\nstone-headed wooden mace, great agility, small poisoned darts.  What do\r\nyou make of all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"A savage!\" I exclaimed.  \"Perhaps one of those Indians who were the\r\nassociates of Jonathan Small.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that,\" said he.  \"When first I saw signs of strange weapons I\r\nwas inclined to think so; but the remarkable character of the footmarks\r\ncaused me to reconsider my views.  Some of the inhabitants of the\r\nIndian Peninsula are small men, but none could have left such marks as\r\nthat.  The Hindoo proper has long and thin feet.  The sandal-wearing\r\nMohammedan has the great toe well separated from the others, because\r\nthe thong is commonly passed between.  These little darts, too, could\r\nonly be shot in one way. They are from a blow-pipe.  Now, then, where\r\nare we to find our savage?\"\r\n\r\n\"South American,\" I hazarded.\r\n\r\nHe stretched his hand up, and took down a bulky volume from the shelf.\r\n\"This is the first volume of a gazetteer which is now being published.\r\nIt may be looked upon as the very latest authority.  What have we here?\r\n'Andaman Islands, situated 340 miles to the north of Sumatra, in the\r\nBay of Bengal.'  Hum! hum! What's all this?  Moist climate, coral\r\nreefs, sharks, Port Blair, convict-barracks, Rutland Island,\r\ncottonwoods--Ah, here we are. 'The aborigines of the Andaman Islands\r\nmay perhaps claim the distinction of being the smallest race upon this\r\nearth, though some anthropologists prefer the Bushmen of Africa, the\r\nDigger Indians of America, and the Terra del Fuegians.  The average\r\nheight is rather below four feet, although many full-grown adults may\r\nbe found who are very much smaller than this.  They are a fierce,\r\nmorose, and intractable people, though capable of forming most devoted\r\nfriendships when their confidence has once been gained.'  Mark that,\r\nWatson.  Now, then, listen to this.  'They are naturally hideous,\r\nhaving large, misshapen heads, small, fierce eyes, and distorted\r\nfeatures.  Their feet and hands, however, are remarkably small.  So\r\nintractable and fierce are they that all the efforts of the British\r\nofficial have failed to win them over in any degree.  They have always\r\nbeen a terror to shipwrecked crews, braining the survivors with their\r\nstone-headed clubs, or shooting them with their poisoned arrows.  These\r\nmassacres are invariably concluded by a cannibal feast.'  Nice, amiable\r\npeople, Watson!  If this fellow had been left to his own unaided\r\ndevices this affair might have taken an even more ghastly turn.  I\r\nfancy that, even as it is, Jonathan Small would give a good deal not to\r\nhave employed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came he to have so singular a companion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that is more than I can tell.  Since, however, we had already\r\ndetermined that Small had come from the Andamans, it is not so very\r\nwonderful that this islander should be with him.  No doubt we shall\r\nknow all about it in time.  Look here, Watson; you look regularly done.\r\nLie down there on the sofa, and see if I can put you to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up his violin from the corner, and as I stretched myself out he\r\nbegan to play some low, dreamy, melodious air,--his own, no doubt, for\r\nhe had a remarkable gift for improvisation.  I have a vague remembrance\r\nof his gaunt limbs, his earnest face, and the rise and fall of his bow.\r\nThen I seemed to be floated peacefully away upon a soft sea of sound,\r\nuntil I found myself in dream-land, with the sweet face of Mary Morstan\r\nlooking down upon me.\r\n\nIt was late in the afternoon before I woke, strengthened and refreshed.\r\nSherlock Holmes still sat exactly as I had left him, save that he had\r\nlaid aside his violin and was deep in a book. He looked across at me,\r\nas I stirred, and I noticed that his face was dark and troubled.\r\n\r\n\"You have slept soundly,\" he said.  \"I feared that our talk would wake\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard nothing,\" I answered.  \"Have you had fresh news, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, no.  I confess that I am surprised and disappointed.  I\r\nexpected something definite by this time. Wiggins has just been up to\r\nreport.  He says that no trace can be found of the launch.  It is a\r\nprovoking check, for every hour is of importance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I do anything?  I am perfectly fresh now, and quite ready for\r\nanother night's outing.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we can do nothing.  We can only wait.  If we go ourselves, the\r\nmessage might come in our absence, and delay be caused.  You can do\r\nwhat you will, but I must remain on guard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall run over to Camberwell and call upon Mrs. Cecil\r\nForrester.  She asked me to, yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"On Mrs. Cecil Forrester?\" asked Holmes, with the twinkle of a smile in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course Miss Morstan too.  They were anxious to hear what\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not tell them too much,\" said Holmes.  \"Women are never to be\r\nentirely trusted,--not the best of them.\"\r\n\r\nI did not pause to argue over this atrocious sentiment.  \"I shall be\r\nback in an hour or two,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"All right!  Good luck!  But, I say, if you are crossing the river you\r\nmay as well return Toby, for I don't think it is at all likely that we\r\nshall have any use for him now.\"\r\n\r\nI took our mongrel accordingly, and left him, together with a\r\nhalf-sovereign, at the old naturalist's in Pinchin Lane.  At Camberwell\r\nI found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night's adventures, but\r\nvery eager to hear the news.  Mrs. Forrester, too, was full of\r\ncuriosity.  I told them all that we had done, suppressing, however, the\r\nmore dreadful parts of the tragedy. Thus, although I spoke of Mr.\r\nSholto's death, I said nothing of the exact manner and method of it.\r\nWith all my omissions, however, there was enough to startle and amaze\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"It is a romance!\" cried Mrs. Forrester.  \"An injured lady, half a\r\nmillion in treasure, a black cannibal, and a wooden-legged ruffian.\r\nThey take the place of the conventional dragon or wicked earl.\"\r\n\r\n\"And two knight-errants to the rescue,\" added Miss Morstan, with a\r\nbright glance at me.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mary, your fortune depends upon the issue of this search. I don't\r\nthink that you are nearly excited enough.  Just imagine what it must be\r\nto be so rich, and to have the world at your feet!\"\r\n\r\nIt sent a little thrill of joy to my heart to notice that she showed no\r\nsign of elation at the prospect.  On the contrary, she gave a toss of\r\nher proud head, as though the matter were one in which she took small\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"It is for Mr. Thaddeus Sholto that I am anxious,\" she said. \"Nothing\r\nelse is of any consequence; but I think that he has behaved most kindly\r\nand honorably throughout.  It is our duty to clear him of this dreadful\r\nand unfounded charge.\"\r\n\r\nIt was evening before I left Camberwell, and quite dark by the time I\r\nreached home.  My companion's book and pipe lay by his chair, but he\r\nhad disappeared.  I looked about in the hope of seeing a note, but\r\nthere was none.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out,\" I said to Mrs.\r\nHudson as she came up to lower the blinds.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.  He has gone to his room, sir.  Do you know, sir,\" sinking\r\nher voice into an impressive whisper, \"I am afraid for his health?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, Mrs. Hudson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he's that strange, sir.  After you was gone he walked and he\r\nwalked, up and down, and up and down, until I was weary of the sound of\r\nhis footstep.  Then I heard him talking to himself and muttering, and\r\nevery time the bell rang out he came on the stairhead, with 'What is\r\nthat, Mrs. Hudson?'  And now he has slammed off to his room, but I can\r\nhear him walking away the same as ever.  I hope he's not going to be\r\nill, sir.  I ventured to say something to him about cooling medicine,\r\nbut he turned on me, sir, with such a look that I don't know how ever I\r\ngot out of the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think that you have any cause to be uneasy, Mrs. Hudson,\" I\r\nanswered.  \"I have seen him like this before.  He has some small matter\r\nupon his mind which makes him restless.\"  I tried to speak lightly to\r\nour worthy landlady, but I was myself somewhat uneasy when through the\r\nlong night I still from time to time heard the dull sound of his tread,\r\nand knew how his keen spirit was chafing against this involuntary\r\ninaction.\r\n\r\nAt breakfast-time he looked worn and haggard, with a little fleck of\r\nfeverish color upon either cheek.\r\n\r\n\"You are knocking yourself up, old man,\" I remarked.  \"I heard you\r\nmarching about in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I could not sleep,\" he answered.  \"This infernal problem is\r\nconsuming me.  It is too much to be balked by so petty an obstacle,\r\nwhen all else had been overcome.  I know the men, the launch,\r\neverything; and yet I can get no news.  I have set other agencies at\r\nwork, and used every means at my disposal.  The whole river has been\r\nsearched on either side, but there is no news, nor has Mrs. Smith heard\r\nof her husband.  I shall come to the conclusion soon that they have\r\nscuttled the craft.  But there are objections to that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or that Mrs. Smith has put us on a wrong scent.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I think that may be dismissed.  I had inquiries made, and there is\r\na launch of that description.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could it have gone up the river?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have considered that possibility too, and there is a search-party\r\nwho will work up as far as Richmond.  If no news comes to-day, I shall\r\nstart off myself to-morrow, and go for the men rather than the boat.\r\nBut surely, surely, we shall hear something.\"\r\n\r\nWe did not, however.  Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from\r\nthe other agencies.  There were articles in most of the papers upon the\r\nNorwood tragedy.  They all appeared to be rather hostile to the\r\nunfortunate Thaddeus Sholto.  No fresh details were to be found,\r\nhowever, in any of them, save that an inquest was to be held upon the\r\nfollowing day.  I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report\r\nour ill success to the ladies, and on my return I found Holmes dejected\r\nand somewhat morose.  He would hardly reply to my questions, and busied\r\nhimself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved\r\nmuch heating of retorts and distilling of vapors, ending at last in a\r\nsmell which fairly drove me out of the apartment. Up to the small hours\r\nof the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told\r\nme that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment.\r\n\r\nIn the early dawn I woke with a start, and was surprised to find him\r\nstanding by my bedside, clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket,\r\nand a coarse red scarf round his neck.\r\n\r\n\"I am off down the river, Watson,\" said he.  \"I have been turning it\r\nover in my mind, and I can see only one way out of it.  It is worth\r\ntrying, at all events.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely I can come with you, then?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No; you can be much more useful if you will remain here as my\r\nrepresentative.  I am loath to go, for it is quite on the cards that\r\nsome message may come during the day, though Wiggins was despondent\r\nabout it last night. I want you to open all notes and telegrams, and to\r\nact on your own judgment if any news should come.  Can I rely upon you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that you will not be able to wire to me, for I can hardly\r\ntell yet where I may find myself.  If I am in luck, however, I may not\r\nbe gone so very long.  I shall have news of some sort or other before I\r\nget back.\"\r\n\r\nI had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time.  On opening the Standard,\r\nhowever, I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business.\r\n\"With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy,\" it remarked, \"we have\r\nreason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and\r\nmysterious than was originally supposed. Fresh evidence has shown that\r\nit is quite impossible that Mr. Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any\r\nway concerned in the matter.  He and the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone,\r\nwere both released yesterday evening.  It is believed, however, that\r\nthe police have a clue as to the real culprits, and that it is being\r\nprosecuted by Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard, with all his\r\nwell-known energy and sagacity.  Further arrests may be expected at any\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is satisfactory so far as it goes,\" thought I.  \"Friend Sholto is\r\nsafe, at any rate.  I wonder what the fresh clue may be; though it\r\nseems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder.\"\r\n\r\nI tossed the paper down upon the table, but at that moment my eye\r\ncaught an advertisement in the agony column.  It ran in this way:\r\n\r\n\"Lost.--Whereas Mordecai Smith, boatman, and his son, Jim, left Smith's\r\nWharf at or about three o'clock last Tuesday morning in the steam\r\nlaunch Aurora, black with two red stripes, funnel black with a white\r\nband, the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give\r\ninformation to Mrs. Smith, at Smith's Wharf, or at 221b Baker Street,\r\nas to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora.\"\r\n\r\nThis was clearly Holmes's doing.  The Baker Street address was enough\r\nto prove that.  It struck me as rather ingenious, because it might be\r\nread by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural\r\nanxiety of a wife for her missing husband.\r\n\r\nIt was a long day.  Every time that a knock came to the door, or a\r\nsharp step passed in the street, I imagined that it was either Holmes\r\nreturning or an answer to his advertisement.  I tried to read, but my\r\nthoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted\r\nand villainous pair whom we were pursuing. Could there be, I wondered,\r\nsome radical flaw in my companion's reasoning.  Might he be suffering\r\nfrom some huge self-deception? Was it not possible that his nimble and\r\nspeculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises?  I\r\nhad never known him to be wrong; and yet the keenest reasoner may\r\noccasionally be deceived.  He was likely, I thought, to fall into error\r\nthrough the over-refinement of his logic,--his preference for a subtle\r\nand bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay\r\nready to his hand.  Yet, on the other hand, I had myself seen the\r\nevidence, and I had heard the reasons for his deductions.  When I\r\nlooked back on the long chain of curious circumstances, many of them\r\ntrivial in themselves, but all tending in the same direction, I could\r\nnot disguise from myself that even if Holmes's explanation were\r\nincorrect the true theory must be equally outre and startling.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell, an\r\nauthoritative voice in the hall, and, to my surprise, no less a person\r\nthan Mr. Athelney Jones was shown up to me.  Very different was he,\r\nhowever, from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who\r\nhad taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood.  His\r\nexpression was downcast, and his bearing meek and even apologetic.\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, sir; good-day,\" said he.  \"Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out, I\r\nunderstand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I cannot be sure when he will be back.  But perhaps you would\r\ncare to wait.  Take that chair and try one of these cigars.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; I don't mind if I do,\" said he, mopping his face with a red\r\nbandanna handkerchief.\r\n\r\n\"And a whiskey-and-soda?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, half a glass.  It is very hot for the time of year; and I have\r\nhad a good deal to worry and try me.  You know my theory about this\r\nNorwood case?\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember that you expressed one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have been obliged to reconsider it.  I had my net drawn\r\ntightly round Mr. Sholto, sir, when pop he went through a hole in the\r\nmiddle of it.  He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken.\r\nFrom the time that he left his brother's room he was never out of sight\r\nof some one or other.  So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and\r\nthrough trap-doors.  It's a very dark case, and my professional credit\r\nis at stake.  I should be very glad of a little assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all need help sometimes,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man, sir,\" said he, in\r\na husky and confidential voice.  \"He's a man who is not to be beat.  I\r\nhave known that young man go into a good many cases, but I never saw\r\nthe case yet that he could not throw a light upon.  He is irregular in\r\nhis methods, and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories, but, on\r\nthe whole, I think he would have made a most promising officer, and I\r\ndon't care who knows it.  I have had a wire from him this morning, by\r\nwhich I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business.\r\nHere is the message.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the telegram out of his pocket, and handed it to me.  It was\r\ndated from Poplar at twelve o'clock.  \"Go to Baker Street at once,\" it\r\nsaid.  \"If I have not returned, wait for me.  I am close on the track\r\nof the Sholto gang.  You can come with us to-night if you want to be in\r\nat the finish.\"\r\n\r\n\"This sounds well.  He has evidently picked up the scent again,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then he has been at fault too,\" exclaimed Jones, with evident\r\nsatisfaction.  \"Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes.  Of\r\ncourse this may prove to be a false alarm; but it is my duty as an\r\nofficer of the law to allow no chance to slip. But there is some one at\r\nthe door.  Perhaps this is he.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy step was heard ascending the stair, with a great wheezing and\r\nrattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath. Once or\r\ntwice he stopped, as though the climb were too much for him, but at\r\nlast he made his way to our door and entered.  His appearance\r\ncorresponded to the sounds which we had heard.  He was an aged man,\r\nclad in seafaring garb, with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his\r\nthroat.  His back was bowed, his knees were shaky, and his breathing\r\nwas painfully asthmatic.  As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his\r\nshoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs.  He had\r\na colored scarf round his chin, and I could see little of his face save\r\na pair of keen dark eyes, overhung by bushy white brows, and long gray\r\nside-whiskers. Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable\r\nmaster mariner who had fallen into years and poverty.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, my man?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age.\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No; but I am acting for him.  You can tell me any message you have for\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to him himself I was to tell it,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But I tell you that I am acting for him.  Was it about Mordecai\r\nSmith's boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  I knows well where it is.  An' I knows where the men he is after\r\nare.  An' I knows where the treasure is.  I knows all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me, and I shall let him know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to him I was to tell it,\" he repeated, with the petulant\r\nobstinacy of a very old man.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you must wait for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I ain't goin' to lose a whole day to please no one.  If Mr.\r\nHolmes ain't here, then Mr. Holmes must find it all out for himself.  I\r\ndon't care about the look of either of you, and I won't tell a word.\"\r\n\r\nHe shuffled towards the door, but Athelney Jones got in front of him.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a bit, my friend,\" said he.  \"You have important information, and\r\nyou must not walk off.  We shall keep you, whether you like or not,\r\nuntil our friend returns.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man made a little run towards the door, but, as Athelney Jones\r\nput his broad back up against it, he recognized the uselessness of\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty sort o' treatment this!\" he cried, stamping his stick. \"I come\r\nhere to see a gentleman, and you two, who I never saw in my life, seize\r\nme and treat me in this fashion!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will be none the worse,\" I said.  \"We shall recompense you for the\r\nloss of your time.  Sit over here on the sofa, and you will not have\r\nlong to wait.\"\r\n\r\nHe came across sullenly enough, and seated himself with his face\r\nresting on his hands.  Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk.\r\nSuddenly, however, Holmes's voice broke in upon us.\r\n\r\n\"I think that you might offer me a cigar too,\" he said.\r\n\r\nWe both started in our chairs.  There was Holmes sitting close to us\r\nwith an air of quiet amusement.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes!\" I exclaimed.  \"You here!  But where is the old man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the old man,\" said he, holding out a heap of white hair. \"Here\r\nhe is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all.  I thought my disguise was\r\npretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, You rogue!\" cried Jones, highly delighted.  \"You would have made\r\nan actor, and a rare one.  You had the proper workhouse cough, and\r\nthose weak legs of yours are worth ten pound a week. I thought I knew\r\nthe glint of your eye, though.  You didn't get away from us so easily,\r\nYou see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been working in that get-up all day,\" said he, lighting his\r\ncigar.  \"You see, a good many of the criminal classes begin to know\r\nme,--especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my\r\ncases:  so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise\r\nlike this.  You got my wire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that was what brought me here.\"\r\n\r\n\"How has your case prospered?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has all come to nothing.  I have had to release two of my\r\nprisoners, and there is no evidence against the other two.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind.  We shall give you two others in the place of them. But\r\nyou must put yourself under my orders.  You are welcome to all the\r\nofficial credit, but you must act on the line that I point out.  Is\r\nthat agreed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely, if you will help me to the men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat--a\r\nsteam launch--to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is easily managed.  There is always one about there; but I can\r\nstep across the road and telephone to make sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall want two stanch men, in case of resistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be two or three in the boat.  What else?\"\r\n\r\n\"When we secure the men we shall get the treasure.  I think that it\r\nwould be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the\r\nyoung lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs.  Let her be the first\r\nto open it.--Eh, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a great pleasure to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rather an irregular proceeding,\" said Jones, shaking his head.\r\n\"However, the whole thing is irregular, and I suppose we must wink at\r\nit.  The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities\r\nuntil after the official investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.  That is easily managed.  One other point.  I should much\r\nlike to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan\r\nSmall himself.  You know I like to work the detail of my cases out.\r\nThere is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him,\r\neither here in my rooms or elsewhere, as long as he is efficiently\r\nguarded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you are master of the situation.  I have had no proof yet of the\r\nexistence of this Jonathan Small.  However, if you can catch him I\r\ndon't see how I can refuse you an interview with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is understood, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.  Is there anything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that I insist upon your dining with us.  It will be ready in half\r\nan hour.  I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little\r\nchoice in white wines.--Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits\r\nas a housekeeper.\"\r\n\nOur meal was a merry one.  Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he\r\nchose, and that night he did choose.  He appeared to be in a state of\r\nnervous exaltation.  I have never known him so brilliant.  He spoke on\r\na quick succession of subjects,--on miracle-plays, on medieval pottery,\r\non Stradivarius violins, on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and on the\r\nwar-ships of the future,--handling each as though he had made a special\r\nstudy of it.  His bright humor marked the reaction from his black\r\ndepression of the preceding days.  Athelney Jones proved to be a\r\nsociable soul in his hours of relaxation, and faced his dinner with the\r\nair of a bon vivant.  For myself, I felt elated at the thought that we\r\nwere nearing the end of our task, and I caught something of Holmes's\r\ngaiety.  None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had\r\nbrought us together.\r\n\r\nWhen the cloth was cleared, Holmes glanced at his watch, and filled up\r\nthree glasses with port.  \"One bumper,\" said he, \"to the success of our\r\nlittle expedition.  And now it is high time we were off.  Have you a\r\npistol, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have my old service-revolver in my desk.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had best take it, then.  It is well to be prepared.  I see that\r\nthe cab is at the door.  I ordered it for half-past six.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf, and\r\nfound our launch awaiting us.  Holmes eyed it critically.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,--that green lamp at the side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take it off.\"\r\n\r\nThe small change was made, we stepped on board, and the ropes were cast\r\noff.  Jones, Holmes, and I sat in the stern.  There was one man at the\r\nrudder, one to tend the engines, and two burly police-inspectors\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"Where to?\" asked Jones.\r\n\r\n\"To the Tower.  Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson's Yard.\"\r\n\r\nOur craft was evidently a very fast one.  We shot past the long lines\r\nof loaded barges as though they were stationary.  Holmes smiled with\r\nsatisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to be able to catch anything on the river,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, hardly that.  But there are not many launches to beat us.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to catch the Aurora, and she has a name for being a\r\nclipper.  I will tell you how the land lies, Watson.  You recollect how\r\nannoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical\r\nanalysis.  One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work\r\nis the best rest.  So it is.  When I had succeeded in dissolving the\r\nhydrocarbon which I was at work at, I came back to our problem of the\r\nSholtos, and thought the whole matter out again.  My boys had been up\r\nthe river and down the river without result.  The launch was not at any\r\nlanding-stage or wharf, nor had it returned.  Yet it could hardly have\r\nbeen scuttled to hide their traces,--though that always remained as a\r\npossible hypothesis if all else failed.  I knew this man Small had a\r\ncertain degree of low cunning, but I did not think him capable of\r\nanything in the nature of delicate finesse.  That is usually a product\r\nof higher education.  I then reflected that since he had certainly been\r\nin London some time--as we had evidence that he maintained a continual\r\nwatch over Pondicherry Lodge--he could hardly leave at a moment's\r\nnotice, but would need some little time, if it were only a day, to\r\narrange his affairs.  That was the balance of probability, at any rate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me to be a little weak,\" said I.  \"It is more probable\r\nthat he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his\r\nexpedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I hardly think so.  This lair of his would be too valuable a\r\nretreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he\r\ncould do without it.  But a second consideration struck me.  Jonathan\r\nSmall must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion,\r\nhowever much he may have top-coated him, would give rise to gossip, and\r\npossibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy.  He was quite sharp\r\nenough to see that.  They had started from their head-quarters under\r\ncover of darkness, and he would wish to get back before it was broad\r\nlight.  Now, it was past three o'clock, according to Mrs. Smith, when\r\nthey got the boat.  It would be quite bright, and people would be about\r\nin an hour or so.  Therefore, I argued, they did not go very far.  They\r\npaid Smith well to hold his tongue, reserved his launch for the final\r\nescape, and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box. In a\r\ncouple of nights, when they had time to see what view the papers took,\r\nand whether there was any suspicion, they would make their way under\r\ncover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs, where no\r\ndoubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the\r\nColonies.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the launch?  They could not have taken that to their lodgings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.  I argued that the launch must be no great way off, in spite\r\nof its invisibility.  I then put myself in the place of Small, and\r\nlooked at it as a man of his capacity would.  He would probably\r\nconsider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would\r\nmake pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track.  How,\r\nthen, could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted?\r\nI wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes.  I could\r\nonly think of one way of doing it.  I might land the launch over to\r\nsome boat-builder or repairer, with directions to make a trifling\r\nchange in her.  She would then be removed to his shed or yard, and so\r\nbe effectually concealed, while at the same time I could have her at a\r\nfew hours' notice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems simple enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be\r\noverlooked.  However, I determined to act on the idea.  I started at\r\nonce in this harmless seaman's rig and inquired at all the yards down\r\nthe river.  I drew blank at fifteen, but at the\r\nsixteenth--Jacobson's--I learned that the Aurora had been handed over\r\nto them two days ago by a wooden-legged man, with some trivial\r\ndirections as to her rudder.  'There ain't naught amiss with her\r\nrudder,' said the foreman.  'There she lies, with the red streaks.'  At\r\nthat moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith, the missing owner?\r\nHe was rather the worse for liquor.  I should not, of course, have\r\nknown him, but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch.  'I\r\nwant her to-night at eight o'clock,' said he,--'eight o'clock sharp,\r\nmind, for I have two gentlemen who won't be kept waiting.'  They had\r\nevidently paid him well, for he was very flush of money, chucking\r\nshillings about to the men.  I followed him some distance, but he\r\nsubsided into an ale-house:  so I went back to the yard, and, happening\r\nto pick up one of my boys on the way, I stationed him as a sentry over\r\nthe launch.  He is to stand at water's edge and wave his handkerchief\r\nto us when they start.  We shall be lying off in the stream, and it\r\nwill be a strange thing if we do not take men, treasure, and all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have planned it all very neatly, whether they are the right men or\r\nnot,\" said Jones; \"but if the affair were in my hands I should have had\r\na body of police in Jacobson's Yard, and arrested them when they came\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which would have been never.  This man Small is a pretty shrewd\r\nfellow.  He would send a scout on ahead, and if anything made him\r\nsuspicious lie snug for another week.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith, and so been led to their\r\nhiding-place,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"In that case I should have wasted my day. I think that it is a hundred\r\nto one against Smith knowing where they live.  As long as he has liquor\r\nand good pay, why should he ask questions?  They send him messages what\r\nto do.  No, I thought over every possible course, and this is the best.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this conversation had been proceeding, we had been shooting the\r\nlong series of bridges which span the Thames.  As we passed the City\r\nthe last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St.\r\nPaul's.  It was twilight before we reached the Tower.\r\n\r\n\"That is Jacobson's Yard,\" said Holmes, pointing to a bristle of masts\r\nand rigging on the Surrey side.  \"Cruise gently up and down here under\r\ncover of this string of lighters.\"  He took a pair of night-glasses\r\nfrom his pocket and gazed some time at the shore. \"I see my sentry at\r\nhis post,\" he remarked, \"but no sign of a handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them,\" said\r\nJones, eagerly.  We were all eager by this time, even the policemen and\r\nstokers, who had a very vague idea of what was going forward.\r\n\r\n\"We have no right to take anything for granted,\" Holmes answered. \"It\r\nis certainly ten to one that they go down-stream, but we cannot be\r\ncertain.  From this point we can see the entrance of the yard, and they\r\ncan hardly see us.  It will be a clear night and plenty of light.  We\r\nmust stay where we are.  See how the folk swarm over yonder in the\r\ngaslight.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are coming from work in the yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dirty-looking rascals, but I suppose every one has some little\r\nimmortal spark concealed about him.  You would not think it, to look at\r\nthem.  There is no a priori probability about it.  A strange enigma is\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\n\"Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Winwood Reade is good upon the subject,\" said Holmes.  \"He remarks\r\nthat, while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle, in the aggregate\r\nhe becomes a mathematical certainty.  You can, for example, never\r\nforetell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what\r\nan average number will be up to.  Individuals vary, but percentages\r\nremain constant.  So says the statistician. But do I see a\r\nhandkerchief?  Surely there is a white flutter over yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is your boy,\" I cried.  \"I can see him plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there is the Aurora,\" exclaimed Holmes, \"and going like the devil!\r\nFull speed ahead, engineer.  Make after that launch with the yellow\r\nlight.  By heaven, I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have\r\nthe heels of us!\"\r\n\r\nShe had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two\r\nor three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up before we\r\nsaw her.  Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the shore,\r\ngoing at a tremendous rate.  Jones looked gravely at her and shook his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"She is very fast,\" he said.  \"I doubt if we shall catch her.\"\r\n\r\n\"We MUST catch her!\" cried Holmes, between his teeth.  \"Heap it on,\r\nstokers!  Make her do all she can!  If we burn the boat we must have\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\nWe were fairly after her now.  The furnaces roared, and the powerful\r\nengines whizzed and clanked, like a great metallic heart.  Her sharp,\r\nsteep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to\r\nright and to left of us.  With every throb of the engines we sprang and\r\nquivered like a living thing. One great yellow lantern in our bows\r\nthrew a long, flickering funnel of light in front of us.  Right ahead a\r\ndark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay, and the swirl of\r\nwhite foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going.  We\r\nflashed past barges, steamers, merchant-vessels, in and out, behind\r\nthis one and round the other.  Voices hailed us out of the darkness,\r\nbut still the Aurora thundered on, and still we followed close upon her\r\ntrack.\r\n\r\n\"Pile it on, men, pile it on!\" cried Holmes, looking down into the\r\nengine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,\r\naquiline face.  \"Get every pound of steam you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we gain a little,\" said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it,\" said I.  \"We shall be up with her in a very few\r\nminutes.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with\r\nthree barges in tow blundered in between us.  It was only by putting\r\nour helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could\r\nround them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred\r\nyards.  She was still, however, well in view, and the murky uncertain\r\ntwilight was setting into a clear starlit night.  Our boilers were\r\nstrained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with\r\nthe fierce energy which was driving us along.  We had shot through the\r\nPool, past the West India Docks, down the long Deptford Reach, and up\r\nagain after rounding the Isle of Dogs.  The dull blur in front of us\r\nresolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora.  Jones\r\nturned our search-light upon her, so that we could plainly see the\r\nfigures upon her deck.  One man sat by the stern, with something black\r\nbetween his knees over which he stooped.  Beside him lay a dark mass\r\nwhich looked like a Newfoundland dog.  The boy held the tiller, while\r\nagainst the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith, stripped to\r\nthe waist, and shovelling coals for dear life.  They may have had some\r\ndoubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them, but now as\r\nwe followed every winding and turning which they took there could no\r\nlonger be any question about it.  At Greenwich we were about three\r\nhundred paces behind them.  At Blackwall we could not have been more\r\nthan two hundred and fifty.  I have coursed many creatures in many\r\ncountries during my checkered career, but never did sport give me such\r\na wild thrill as this mad, flying man-hunt down the Thames.  Steadily\r\nwe drew in upon them, yard by yard.  In the silence of the night we\r\ncould hear the panting and clanking of their machinery.  The man in the\r\nstern still crouched upon the deck, and his arms were moving as though\r\nhe were busy, while every now and then he would look up and measure\r\nwith a glance the distance which still separated us.  Nearer we came\r\nand nearer. Jones yelled to them to stop.  We were not more than four\r\nboat's lengths behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace.  It\r\nwas a clear reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and\r\nthe melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other.  At our hail the man\r\nin the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists\r\nat us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,\r\npowerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could\r\nsee that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the\r\nright side.  At the sound of his strident, angry cries there was\r\nmovement in the huddled bundle upon the deck.  It straightened itself\r\ninto a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a great,\r\nmisshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.  Holmes had\r\nalready drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the sight of this\r\nsavage, distorted creature.  He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster\r\nor blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that face was enough\r\nto give a man a sleepless night.  Never have I seen features so deeply\r\nmarked with all bestiality and cruelty.  His small eyes glowed and\r\nburned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were writhed back from\r\nhis teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury.\r\n\r\n\"Fire if he raises his hand,\" said Holmes, quietly.  We were within a\r\nboat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry.  I\r\ncan see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his legs\r\nfar apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his\r\nhideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light\r\nof our lantern.\r\n\r\nIt was well that we had so clear a view of him.  Even as we looked he\r\nplucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood, like\r\na school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out\r\ntogether.  He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of\r\nchoking cough fell sideways into the stream.  I caught one glimpse of\r\nhis venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters.  At the\r\nsame moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put\r\nit hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank,\r\nwhile we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a few feet.  We were\r\nround after her in an instant, but she was already nearly at the bank.\r\nIt was a wild and desolate place, where the moon glimmered upon a wide\r\nexpanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant water and beds of\r\ndecaying vegetation.  The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the\r\nmud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water.\r\nThe fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank its whole length\r\ninto the sodden soil.  In vain he struggled and writhed.  Not one step\r\ncould he possibly take either forwards or backwards.  He yelled in\r\nimpotent rage, and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot,\r\nbut his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky\r\nbank.  When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored\r\nthat it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that\r\nwe were able to haul him out, and to drag him, like some evil fish,\r\nover our side.  The two Smiths, father and son, sat sullenly in their\r\nlaunch, but came aboard meekly enough when commanded.  The Aurora\r\nherself we hauled off and made fast to our stern.  A solid iron chest\r\nof Indian workmanship stood upon the deck.  This, there could be no\r\nquestion, was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of\r\nthe Sholtos.  There was no key, but it was of considerable weight, so\r\nwe transferred it carefully to our own little cabin.  As we steamed\r\nslowly up-stream again, we flashed our search-light in every direction,\r\nbut there was no sign of the Islander.  Somewhere in the dark ooze at\r\nthe bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our\r\nshores.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"See here,\" said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway.  \"We were\r\nhardly quick enough with our pistols.\"  There, sure enough, just behind\r\nwhere we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts which we\r\nknew so well.  It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we\r\nfired.  Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy\r\nfashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible\r\ndeath which had passed so close to us that night.\r\n\nOur captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done\r\nso much and waited so long to gain.  He was a sunburned, reckless-eyed\r\nfellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany\r\nfeatures, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular\r\nprominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be\r\neasily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or\r\nthereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray.  His\r\nface in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and\r\naggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression\r\nwhen moved to anger.  He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his\r\nlap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen,\r\ntwinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings.\r\nIt seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and\r\ncontained countenance.  Once he looked up at me with a gleam of\r\nsomething like humor in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jonathan Small,\" said Holmes, lighting a cigar, \"I am sorry that\r\nit has come to this.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so am I, sir,\" he answered, frankly.  \"I don't believe that I can\r\nswing over the job.  I give you my word on the book that I never raised\r\nhand against Mr. Sholto.  It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot\r\none of his cursed darts into him.  I had no part in it, sir.  I was as\r\ngrieved as if it had been my blood-relation.  I welted the little devil\r\nwith the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not\r\nundo it again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a cigar,\" said Holmes; \"and you had best take a pull out of my\r\nflask, for you are very wet.  How could you expect so small and weak a\r\nman as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you\r\nwere climbing the rope?\"\r\n\r\n\"You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth\r\nis that I hoped to find the room clear.  I knew the habits of the house\r\npretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to\r\nhis supper.  I shall make no secret of the business.  The best defence\r\nthat I can make is just the simple truth.  Now, if it had been the old\r\nmajor I would have swung for him with a light heart.  I would have\r\nthought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar.  But it's\r\ncursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I\r\nhad no quarrel whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard.  He\r\nis going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true\r\naccount of the matter.  You must make a clean breast of it, for if you\r\ndo I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the\r\npoison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached\r\nthe room.\"\r\n\r\n\"That he was, sir.  I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw\r\nhim grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through\r\nthe window.  It fairly shook me, sir.  I'd have half killed Tonga for\r\nit if he had not scrambled off.  That was how he came to leave his\r\nclub, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say\r\nhelped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than\r\nI can tell.  I don't feel no malice against you for it.  But it does\r\nseem a queer thing,\" he added, with a bitter smile, \"that I who have a\r\nfair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first\r\nhalf of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to\r\nspend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor.  It was an evil day\r\nfor me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do\r\nwith the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet\r\nupon the man who owned it.  To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto\r\nit brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life.\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders\r\ninto the tiny cabin.  \"Quite a family party,\" he remarked.  \"I think I\r\nshall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all\r\ncongratulate each other.  Pity we didn't take the other alive; but\r\nthere was no choice.  I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it\r\nrather fine.  It was all we could do to overhaul her.\"\r\n\r\n\"All is well that ends well,\" said Holmes.  \"But I certainly did not\r\nknow that the Aurora was such a clipper.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that\r\nif he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never\r\nhave caught her.  He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither he did,\" cried our prisoner,--\"not a word.  I chose his launch\r\nbecause I heard that she was a flier.  We told him nothing, but we paid\r\nhim well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our\r\nvessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazils.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him.\r\nIf we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in\r\ncondemning them.\"  It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones\r\nwas already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the\r\ncapture.  From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's\r\nface, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.\r\n\r\n\"We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently,\" said Jones, \"and shall land\r\nyou, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box.  I need hardly tell you that I\r\nam taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this.  It is\r\nmost irregular; but of course an agreement is an agreement.  I must,\r\nhowever, as a matter of duty, send an inspector with you, since you\r\nhave so valuable a charge.  You will drive, no doubt?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall drive.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first.\r\nYou will have to break it open.  Where is the key, my man?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the bottom of the river,\" said Small, shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Hum!  There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble.  We have\r\nhad work enough already through you.  However, doctor, I need not warn\r\nyou to be careful.  Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street\r\nrooms.  You will find us there, on our way to the station.\"\r\n\r\nThey landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,\r\ngenial inspector as my companion.  A quarter of an hour's drive brought\r\nus to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's.  The servant seemed surprised at so late\r\na visitor.  Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she\r\nexplained, and likely to be very late.  Miss Morstan, however, was in\r\nthe drawing-room:  so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving\r\nthe obliging inspector in the cab.\r\n\r\nShe was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white\r\ndiaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and\r\nwaist.  The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned\r\nback in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and\r\ntinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant\r\nhair.  One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and\r\nher whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy.  At the\r\nsound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright\r\nflush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"I heard a cab drive up,\" she said.  \"I thought that Mrs. Forrester had\r\ncome back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.  What\r\nnews have you brought me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have brought something better than news,\" said I, putting down the\r\nbox upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my\r\nheart was heavy within me.  \"I have brought you something which is\r\nworth all the news in the world.  I have brought you a fortune.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the iron box.  \"Is that the treasure, then?\" she asked,\r\ncoolly enough.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, this is the great Agra treasure.  Half of it is yours and half is\r\nThaddeus Sholto's.  You will have a couple of hundred thousand each.\r\nThink of that!  An annuity of ten thousand pounds.  There will be few\r\nricher young ladies in England.  Is it not glorious?\"\r\n\r\nI think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that\r\nshe detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her\r\neyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.\r\n\r\n\"If I have it,\" said she, \"I owe it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" I answered, \"not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.\r\nWith all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue\r\nwhich has taxed even his analytical genius. As it was, we very nearly\r\nlost it at the last moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson,\" said she.\r\n\r\nI narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her\r\nlast,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora, the\r\nappearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and the\r\nwild chase down the Thames.  She listened with parted lips and shining\r\neyes to my recital of our adventures.  When I spoke of the dart which\r\nhad so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I feared that she\r\nwas about to faint.\r\n\r\n\"It is nothing,\" she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.\r\n\"I am all right again.  It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed\r\nmy friends in such horrible peril.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all over,\" I answered.  \"It was nothing.  I will tell you no\r\nmore gloomy details.  Let us turn to something brighter. There is the\r\ntreasure.  What could be brighter than that?  I got leave to bring it\r\nwith me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be of the greatest interest to me,\" she said.  There was no\r\neagerness in her voice, however.  It had struck her, doubtless, that it\r\nmight seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which\r\nhad cost so much to win.\r\n\r\n\"What a pretty box!\" she said, stooping over it.  \"This is Indian work,\r\nI suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it is Benares metal-work.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so heavy!\" she exclaimed, trying to raise it.  \"The box alone must\r\nbe of some value.  Where is the key?\"\r\n\r\n\"Small threw it into the Thames,\" I answered.  \"I must borrow Mrs.\r\nForrester's poker.\"  There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,\r\nwrought in the image of a sitting Buddha.  Under this I thrust the end\r\nof the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open\r\nwith a loud snap.  With trembling fingers I flung back the lid.  We\r\nboth stood gazing in astonishment.  The box was empty!\r\n\r\nNo wonder that it was heavy.  The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch\r\nthick all round.  It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest\r\nconstructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or crumb\r\nof metal or jewelry lay within it.  It was absolutely and completely\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\"The treasure is lost,\" said Miss Morstan, calmly.\r\n\r\nAs I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great shadow\r\nseemed to pass from my soul.  I did not know how this Agra treasure had\r\nweighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.  It was\r\nselfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize nothing save\r\nthat the golden barrier was gone from between us.  \"Thank God!\" I\r\nejaculated from my very heart.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with a quick, questioning smile.  \"Why do you say\r\nthat?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because you are within my reach again,\" I said, taking her hand. She\r\ndid not withdraw it.  \"Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a man\r\nloved a woman.  Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my lips.\r\nNow that they are gone I can tell you how I love you.  That is why I\r\nsaid, 'Thank God.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I say, 'Thank God,' too,\" she whispered, as I drew her to my\r\nside.  Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had gained\r\none.\r\n\nA very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary\r\ntime before I rejoined him.  His face clouded over when I showed him\r\nthe empty box.\r\n\r\n\"There goes the reward!\" said he, gloomily.  \"Where there is no money\r\nthere is no pay.  This night's work would have been worth a tenner each\r\nto Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man,\" I said.  \"He will see that you are\r\nrewarded, treasure or no.\"\r\n\r\nThe inspector shook his head despondently, however.  \"It's a bad job,\"\r\nhe repeated; \"and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think.\"\r\n\r\nHis forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank\r\nenough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They\r\nhad only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had\r\nchanged their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon\r\nthe way.  My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual listless\r\nexpression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden\r\nleg cocked over his sound one.  As I exhibited the empty box he leaned\r\nback in his chair and laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"This is your doing, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it,\" he\r\ncried, exultantly.  \"It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot\r\nI'll take darned good care that no one else does.  I tell you that no\r\nliving man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the\r\nAndaman convict-barracks and myself.  I know now that I cannot have the\r\nuse of it, and I know that they cannot.  I have acted all through for\r\nthem as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always.\r\nWell I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and\r\nthrow the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin\r\nof Sholto or of Morstan.  It was not to make them rich that we did for\r\nAchmet.  You'll find the treasure where the key is, and where little\r\nTonga is.  When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot\r\naway in a safe place.  There are no rupees for you this journey.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are deceiving us, Small,\" said Athelney Jones, sternly.  \"If you\r\nhad wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been\r\neasier for you to have thrown box and all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover,\" he answered,\r\nwith a shrewd, sidelong look.  \"The man that was clever enough to hunt\r\nme down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a\r\nriver.  Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a\r\nharder job.  It went to my heart to do it, though.  I was half mad when\r\nyou came up with us.  However, there's no good grieving over it.  I've\r\nhad ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry\r\nover spilled milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is a very serious matter, Small,\" said the detective.  \"If you\r\nhad helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would have\r\nhad a better chance at your trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"Justice!\" snarled the ex-convict.  \"A pretty justice!  Whose loot is\r\nthis, if it is not ours?  Where is the justice that I should give it up\r\nto those who have never earned it?  Look how I have earned it!  Twenty\r\nlong years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the\r\nmangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten\r\nby mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced\r\npoliceman who loved to take it out of a white man.  That was how I\r\nearned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice because I\r\ncannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may\r\nenjoy it!  I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of\r\nTonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that\r\nanother man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be\r\nmine.\" Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this came out in\r\na wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the handcuffs clanked\r\ntogether with the impassioned movement of his hands.  I could\r\nunderstand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was\r\nno groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when\r\nhe first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.\r\n\r\n\"You forget that we know nothing of all this,\" said Holmes quietly.\r\n\"We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may\r\noriginally have been on your side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that\r\nI have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.  Still,\r\nI bear no grudge for that.  It is all fair and above-board.  If you\r\nwant to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say to you\r\nis God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the glass\r\nbeside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.\r\n\r\n\"I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore.  I dare say you\r\nwould find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.  I\r\nhave often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that\r\nI was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would\r\nbe so very glad to see me.  They were all steady, chapel-going folk,\r\nsmall farmers, well known and respected over the country-side, while I\r\nwas always a bit of a rover.  At last, however, when I was about\r\neighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a\r\ngirl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's shilling\r\nand joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however.  I had just got past\r\nthe goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough\r\nto go swimming in the Ganges.  Luckily for me, my company sergeant,\r\nJohn Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the\r\nfinest swimmers in the service.  A crocodile took me, just as I was\r\nhalf-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon\r\ncould have done it, just above the knee.  What with the shock and the\r\nloss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder had not\r\ncaught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in\r\nhospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with\r\nthis timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided out of\r\nthe army and unfitted for any active occupation.\r\n\r\n\"I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I\r\nwas a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my\r\nmisfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named\r\nAbelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an\r\noverseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work.  He\r\nhappened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest in\r\nme since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel\r\nrecommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to be\r\ndone on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough knee\r\nleft to keep good grip on the saddle.  What I had to do was to ride\r\nover the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to\r\nreport the idlers.  The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and\r\naltogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in\r\nindigo-planting.  Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would often drop\r\ninto my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out\r\nthere feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was never in luck's way long.  Suddenly, without a note of\r\nwarning, the great mutiny broke upon us.  One month India lay as still\r\nand peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were\r\ntwo hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a\r\nperfect hell.  Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal more\r\nthan I do, very like, since reading is not in my line.  I only know\r\nwhat I saw with my own eyes.  Our plantation was at a place called\r\nMuttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces.  Night after night\r\nthe whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day\r\nwe had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with\r\ntheir wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest\r\ntroops.  Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man.  He had it in his head\r\nthat the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as\r\nsuddenly as it had sprung up.  There he sat on his veranda, drinking\r\nwhiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze\r\nabout him.  Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his\r\nwife, used to do the book-work and the managing.  Well, one fine day\r\nthe crash came.  I had been away on a distant plantation, and was\r\nriding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all\r\nhuddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah.  I rode down to see\r\nwhat it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was\r\nDawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and\r\nnative dogs.  A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on\r\nhis face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand and four\r\nSepoys lying across each other in front of him.  I reined up my horse,\r\nwondering which way I should turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke\r\ncurling up from Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst\r\nthrough the roof.  I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but\r\nwould only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter.  From\r\nwhere I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red\r\ncoats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning\r\nhouse.  Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past\r\nmy head; so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late\r\nat night safe within the walls at Agra.\r\n\r\n\"As it proved, however, there was no great safety there, either. The\r\nwhole country was up like a swarm of bees.  Wherever the English could\r\ncollect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns\r\ncommanded.  Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives.  It was a\r\nfight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of\r\nit was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners,\r\nwere our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling\r\nour own weapons, and blowing our own bugle-calls.  At Agra there were\r\nthe 3d Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery\r\nof artillery.  A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been\r\nformed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all.  We went out to meet the\r\nrebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time,\r\nbut our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city.\r\nNothing but the worst news came to us from every side,--which is not to\r\nbe wondered at, for if you look at the map you will see that we were\r\nright in the heart of it.  Lucknow is rather better than a hundred\r\nmiles to the east, and Cawnpore about as far to the south.  From every\r\npoint on the compass there was nothing but torture and murder and\r\noutrage.\r\n\r\n\"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce\r\ndevil-worshippers of all sorts.  Our handful of men were lost among the\r\nnarrow, winding streets.  Our leader moved across the river, therefore,\r\nand took up his position in the old fort at Agra.  I don't know if any\r\nof you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort.  It\r\nis a very queer place,--the queerest that ever I was in, and I have\r\nbeen in some rum corners, too.  First of all, it is enormous in size.\r\nI should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres.  There is a\r\nmodern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and\r\neverything else, with plenty of room over.  But the modern part is\r\nnothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which\r\nis given over to the scorpions and the centipedes.  It is all full of\r\ngreat deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting\r\nin and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it.  For\r\nthis reason it was seldom that any one went into it, though now and\r\nagain a party with torches might go exploring.\r\n\r\n\"The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it,\r\nbut on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be\r\nguarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was\r\nactually held by our troops.  We were short-handed, with hardly men\r\nenough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns.  It was\r\nimpossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of\r\nthe innumerable gates.  What we did was to organize a central\r\nguard-house in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the\r\ncharge of one white man and two or three natives.  I was selected to\r\ntake charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door\r\nupon the southwest side of the building.  Two Sikh troopers were placed\r\nunder my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire\r\nmy musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central\r\nguard.  As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as\r\nthe space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and\r\ncorridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time\r\nto be of any use in case of an actual attack.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since\r\nI was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that.  For two nights I\r\nkept the watch with my Punjaubees.  They were tall, fierce-looking\r\nchaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting-men\r\nwho had borne arms against us at Chilian-wallah.  They could talk\r\nEnglish pretty well, but I could get little out of them.  They\r\npreferred to stand together and jabber all night in their queer Sikh\r\nlingo.  For myself, I used to stand outside the gate-way, looking down\r\non the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great\r\ncity.  The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and\r\nhowls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to\r\nremind us all night of our dangerous neighbors across the stream.\r\nEvery two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the\r\nposts, to make sure that all was well.\r\n\r\n\"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small, driving\r\nrain.  It was dreary work standing in the gate-way hour after hour in\r\nsuch weather.  I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but\r\nwithout much success.  At two in the morning the rounds passed, and\r\nbroke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my\r\ncompanions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe, and\r\nlaid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs\r\nwere upon me.  One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at\r\nmy head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore\r\nbetween his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step.\r\n\r\n\"My first thought was that these fellows were in league with the\r\nrebels, and that this was the beginning of an assault.  If our door\r\nwere in the hands of the Sepoys the place must fall, and the women and\r\nchildren be treated as they were in Cawnpore.  Maybe you gentlemen\r\nthink that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my\r\nword that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife\r\nat my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream,\r\nif it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard.  The man who\r\nheld me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it,\r\nhe whispered, 'Don't make a noise.  The fort is safe enough.  There are\r\nno rebel dogs on this side of the river.'  There was the ring of truth\r\nin what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man.\r\nI could read it in the fellow's brown eyes.  I waited, therefore, in\r\nsilence, to see what it was that they wanted from me.\r\n\r\n\"'Listen to me, Sahib,' said the taller and fiercer of the pair, the\r\none whom they called Abdullah Khan.  'You must either be with us now or\r\nyou must be silenced forever.  The thing is too great a one for us to\r\nhesitate.  Either you are heart and soul with us on your oath on the\r\ncross of the Christians, or your body this night shall be thrown into\r\nthe ditch and we shall pass over to our brothers in the rebel army.\r\nThere is no middle way.  Which is it to be, death or life?  We can only\r\ngive you three minutes to decide, for the time is passing, and all must\r\nbe done before the rounds come again.'\r\n\r\n\"'How can I decide?' said I.  'You have not told me what you want of\r\nme.  But I tell you now that if it is anything against the safety of\r\nthe fort I will have no truck with it, so you can drive home your knife\r\nand welcome.'\r\n\r\n\"'It is nothing against the fort,' said he.  'We only ask you to do\r\nthat which your countrymen come to this land for.  We ask you to be\r\nrich.  If you will be one of us this night, we will swear to you upon\r\nthe naked knife, and by the threefold oath which no Sikh was ever known\r\nto break, that you shall have your fair share of the loot.  A quarter\r\nof the treasure shall be yours.  We can say no fairer.'\r\n\r\n\"'But what is the treasure, then?' I asked.  'I am as ready to be rich\r\nas you can be, if you will but show me how it can be done.'\r\n\r\n\"'You will swear, then,' said he, 'by the bones of your father, by the\r\nhonor of your mother, by the cross of your faith, to raise no hand and\r\nspeak no word against us, either now or afterwards?'\r\n\r\n\"'I will swear it,' I answered, 'provided that the fort is not\r\nendangered.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then my comrade and I will swear that you shall have a quarter of the\r\ntreasure which shall be equally divided among the four of us.'\r\n\r\n\"'There are but three,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'No; Dost Akbar must have his share.  We can tell the tale to you\r\nwhile we await them.  Do you stand at the gate, Mahomet Singh, and give\r\nnotice of their coming.  The thing stands thus, Sahib, and I tell it to\r\nyou because I know that an oath is binding upon a Feringhee, and that\r\nwe may trust you.  Had you been a lying Hindoo, though you had sworn by\r\nall the gods in their false temples, your blood would have been upon\r\nthe knife, and your body in the water.  But the Sikh knows the\r\nEnglishman, and the Englishman knows the Sikh.  Hearken, then, to what\r\nI have to say.\r\n\r\n\"'There is a rajah in the northern provinces who has much wealth,\r\nthough his lands are small.  Much has come to him from his father, and\r\nmore still he has set by himself, for he is of a low nature and hoards\r\nhis gold rather than spend it.  When the troubles broke out he would be\r\nfriends both with the lion and the tiger,--with the Sepoy and with the\r\nCompany's Raj.  Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men's\r\nday was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of\r\ntheir death and their overthrow.  Yet, being a careful man, he made\r\nsuch plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should\r\nbe left to him.  That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in\r\nthe vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest\r\npearls that he had he put in an iron box, and sent it by a trusty\r\nservant who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort\r\nat Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels\r\nwon he would have his money, but if the Company conquered his jewels\r\nwould be saved to him.  Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself\r\ninto the cause of the Sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders.\r\nBy doing this, mark you, Sahib, his property becomes the due of those\r\nwho have been true to their salt.\r\n\r\n\"'This pretended merchant, who travels under the name of Achmet, is now\r\nin the city of Agra, and desires to gain his way into the fort.  He has\r\nwith him as travelling-companion my foster-brother Dost Akbar, who\r\nknows his secret.  Dost Akbar has promised this night to lead him to a\r\nside-postern of the fort, and has chosen this one for his purpose.\r\nHere he will come presently, and here he will find Mahomet Singh and\r\nmyself awaiting him.  The place is lonely, and none shall know of his\r\ncoming.  The world shall know of the merchant Achmet no more, but the\r\ngreat treasure of the rajah shall be divided among us.  What say you to\r\nit, Sahib?'\r\n\r\n\"In Worcestershire the life of a man seems a great and a sacred thing;\r\nbut it is very different when there is fire and blood all round you and\r\nyou have been used to meeting death at every turn. Whether Achmet the\r\nmerchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me, but at the\r\ntalk about the treasure my heart turned to it, and I thought of what I\r\nmight do in the old country with it, and how my folk would stare when\r\nthey saw their ne'er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold\r\nmoidores.  I had, therefore, already made up my mind.  Abdullah Khan,\r\nhowever, thinking that I hesitated, pressed the matter more closely.\r\n\r\n\"'Consider, Sahib,' said he, 'that if this man is taken by the\r\ncommandant he will be hung or shot, and his jewels taken by the\r\ngovernment, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now,\r\nsince we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?\r\nThe jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers.  There\r\nwill be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs.  No\r\none can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.\r\nWhat could be better for the purpose? Say again, then, Sahib, whether\r\nyou are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am with you heart and soul,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'It is well,' he answered, handing me back my firelock.  'You see that\r\nwe trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken.  We have\r\nnow only to wait for my brother and the merchant.'\r\n\r\n\"'Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'The plan is his.  He has devised it.  We will go to the gate and\r\nshare the watch with Mahomet Singh.'\r\n\r\n\"The rain was still falling steadily, for it was just the beginning of\r\nthe wet season.  Brown, heavy clouds were drifting across the sky, and\r\nit was hard to see more than a stone-cast.  A deep moat lay in front of\r\nour door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could\r\neasily be crossed.  It was strange to me to be standing there with\r\nthose two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side\r\nof the moat.  It vanished among the mound-heaps, and then appeared\r\nagain coming slowly in our direction.\r\n\r\n\"'Here they are!' I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"'You will challenge him, Sahib, as usual,' whispered Abdullah. 'Give\r\nhim no cause for fear.  Send us in with him, and we shall do the rest\r\nwhile you stay here on guard.  Have the lantern ready to uncover, that\r\nwe may be sure that it is indeed the man.'\r\n\r\n\"The light had flickered onwards, now stopping and now advancing, until\r\nI could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat.  I let\r\nthem scramble down the sloping bank, splash through the mire, and climb\r\nhalf-way up to the gate, before I challenged them.\r\n\r\n\"'Who goes there?' said I, in a subdued voice.\r\n\r\n\"'Friends,' came the answer.  I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood\r\nof light upon them.  The first was an enormous Sikh, with a black beard\r\nwhich swept nearly down to his cummerbund.  Outside of a show I have\r\nnever seen so tall a man.  The other was a little, fat, round fellow,\r\nwith a great yellow turban, and a bundle in his hand, done up in a\r\nshawl.  He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear, for his hands\r\ntwitched as if he had the ague, and his head kept turning to left and\r\nright with two bright little twinkling eyes, like a mouse when he\r\nventures out from his hole.  It gave me the chills to think of killing\r\nhim, but I thought of the treasure, and my heart set as hard as a flint\r\nwithin me.  When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy\r\nand came running up towards me.\r\n\r\n\"'Your protection, Sahib,' he panted,--'your protection for the unhappy\r\nmerchant Achmet.  I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek\r\nthe shelter of the fort at Agra.  I have been robbed and beaten and\r\nabused because I have been the friend of the Company.  It is a blessed\r\nnight this when I am once more in safety,--I and my poor possessions.'\r\n\r\n\"'What have you in the bundle?' I asked.\r\n\r\n\"'An iron box,' he answered, 'which contains one or two little family\r\nmatters which are of no value to others, but which I should be sorry to\r\nlose.  Yet I am not a beggar; and I shall reward you, young Sahib, and\r\nyour governor also, if he will give me the shelter I ask.'\r\n\r\n\"I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man.  The more I\r\nlooked at his fat, frightened face, the harder did it seem that we\r\nshould slay him in cold blood.  It was best to get it over.\r\n\r\n\"'Take him to the main guard,' said I.  The two Sikhs closed in upon\r\nhim on each side, and the giant walked behind, while they marched in\r\nthrough the dark gate-way.  Never was a man so compassed round with\r\ndeath.  I remained at the gate-way with the lantern.\r\n\r\n\"I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through\r\nthe lonely corridors.  Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices, and a\r\nscuffle, with the sound of blows.  A moment later there came, to my\r\nhorror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with the loud\r\nbreathing of a running man.  I turned my lantern down the long,\r\nstraight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind,\r\nwith a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding\r\nlike a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in\r\nhis hand.  I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant.\r\nHe was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me\r\nand got to the open air he would save himself yet.  My heart softened\r\nto him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and\r\nbitter.  I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past, and he\r\nrolled twice over like a shot rabbit.  Ere he could stagger to his feet\r\nthe Sikh was upon him, and buried his knife twice in his side.  The man\r\nnever uttered moan nor moved muscle, but lay were he had fallen.  I\r\nthink myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall.  You see,\r\ngentlemen, that I am keeping my promise.  I am telling you every work\r\nof the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favor\r\nor not.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water\r\nwhich Holmes had brewed for him.  For myself, I confess that I had now\r\nconceived the utmost horror of the man, not only for this cold-blooded\r\nbusiness in which he had been concerned, but even more for the somewhat\r\nflippant and careless way in which he narrated it.  Whatever punishment\r\nwas in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.\r\nSherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees, deeply\r\ninterested in the story, but with the same disgust written upon their\r\nfaces. He may have observed it, for there was a touch of defiance in\r\nhis voice and manner as he proceeded.\r\n\r\n\"It was all very bad, no doubt,\" said he.  \"I should like to know how\r\nmany fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when\r\nthey knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains.\r\nBesides, it was my life or his when once he was in the fort.  If he had\r\ngot out, the whole business would come to light, and I should have been\r\ncourt-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were not very\r\nlenient at a time like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on with your story,\" said Holmes, shortly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we carried him in, Abdullah, Akbar, and I.  A fine weight he\r\nwas, too, for all that he was so short.  Mahomet Singh was left to\r\nguard the door.  We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already\r\nprepared.  It was some distance off, where a winding passage leads to a\r\ngreat empty hall, the brick walls of which were all crumbling to\r\npieces.  The earth floor had sunk in at one place, making a natural\r\ngrave, so we left Achmet the merchant there, having first covered him\r\nover with loose bricks.  This done, we all went back to the treasure.\r\n\r\n\"It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked.  The box\r\nwas the same which now lies open upon your table.  A key was hung by a\r\nsilken cord to that carved handle upon the top.  We opened it, and the\r\nlight of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have\r\nread of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore.  It was\r\nblinding to look upon them.  When we had feasted our eyes we took them\r\nall out and made a list of them.  There were one hundred and\r\nforty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been\r\ncalled, I believe, 'the Great Mogul' and is said to be the second\r\nlargest stone in existence.  Then there were ninety-seven very fine\r\nemeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however,\r\nwere small.  There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten\r\nsapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes,\r\ncats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did\r\nnot know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them\r\nsince.  Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls,\r\ntwelve of which were set in a gold coronet.  By the way, these last had\r\nbeen taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it.\r\n\r\n\"After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and\r\ncarried them to the gate-way to show them to Mahomet Singh.  Then we\r\nsolemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our\r\nsecret.  We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the\r\ncountry should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among\r\nourselves.  There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of\r\nsuch value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was\r\nno privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them.  We\r\ncarried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the\r\nbody, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we\r\nmade a hollow and put our treasure.  We made careful note of the place,\r\nand next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of\r\nthe four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each\r\nalways act for all, so that none might take advantage.  That is an oath\r\nthat I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian\r\nmutiny.  After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the\r\nback of the business was broken.  Fresh troops came pouring in, and\r\nNana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier. A flying column under\r\nColonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from\r\nit.  Peace seemed to be settling upon the country, and we four were\r\nbeginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off\r\nwith our shares of the plunder.  In a moment, however, our hopes were\r\nshattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet.\r\n\r\n\"It came about in this way.  When the rajah put his jewels into the\r\nhands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man.\r\nThey are suspicious folk in the East, however:  so what does this rajah\r\ndo but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the\r\nspy upon the first?  This second man was ordered never to let Achmet\r\nout of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow.  He went after\r\nhim that night and saw him pass through the doorway.  Of course he\r\nthought he had taken refuge in the fort, and applied for admission\r\nthere himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet.  This seemed\r\nto him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who\r\nbrought it to the ears of the commandant.  A thorough search was\r\nquickly made, and the body was discovered.  Thus at the very moment\r\nthat we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought\r\nto trial on a charge of murder,--three of us because we had held the\r\ngate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in\r\nthe company of the murdered man.  Not a word about the jewels came out\r\nat the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India:\r\nso no one had any particular interest in them.  The murder, however,\r\nwas clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been\r\nconcerned in it.  The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I\r\nwas condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted into\r\nthe same as the others.\r\n\r\n\"It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then. There\r\nwe were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of\r\never getting out again, while we each held a secret which might have\r\nput each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it.  It\r\nwas enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick\r\nand the cuff of every petty jack-in-office, to have rice to eat and\r\nwater to drink, when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside,\r\njust waiting to be picked up.  It might have driven me mad; but I was\r\nalways a pretty stubborn one, so I just held on and bided my time.\r\n\r\n\"At last it seemed to me to have come.  I was changed from Agra to\r\nMadras, and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans.  There are very\r\nfew white convicts at this settlement, and, as I had behaved well from\r\nthe first, I soon found myself a sort of privileged person.  I was\r\ngiven a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount\r\nHarriet, and I was left pretty much to myself.  It is a dreary,\r\nfever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested\r\nwith wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned\r\ndart at us if they saw a chance.  There was digging, and ditching, and\r\nyam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy\r\nenough all day; though in the evening we had a little time to\r\nourselves.  Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the\r\nsurgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge.  All the time I\r\nwas on the lookout for a chance of escape; but it is hundreds of miles\r\nfrom any other land, and there is little or no wind in those seas:  so\r\nit was a terribly difficult job to get away.\r\n\r\n\"The surgeon, Dr. Somerton, was a fast, sporting young chap, and the\r\nother young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play\r\ncards.  The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his\r\nsitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt\r\nlonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then,\r\nstanding there, I could hear their talk and watch their play.  I am\r\nfond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one\r\nto watch the others.  There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and\r\nLieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and\r\nthere was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials,\r\ncrafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game.  A very snug little\r\nparty they used to make.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there was one thing which very soon struck me, and that was that\r\nthe soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win.  Mind, I\r\ndon't say that there was anything unfair, but so it was.  These\r\nprison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had\r\nbeen at the Andamans, and they knew each other's game to a point, while\r\nthe others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down\r\nanyhow.  Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the\r\npoorer they got the more keen they were to play.  Major Sholto was the\r\nhardest hit.  He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it\r\ncame to notes of hand and for big sums.  He sometimes would win for a\r\nfew deals, just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in\r\nagainst him worse than ever.  All day he would wander about as black as\r\nthunder, and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him.\r\n\r\n\"One night he lost even more heavily than usual.  I was sitting in my\r\nhut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to\r\ntheir quarters.  They were bosom friends, those two, and never far\r\napart.  The major was raving about his losses.\r\n\r\n\"'It's all up, Morstan,' he was saying, as they passed my hut. 'I shall\r\nhave to send in my papers.  I am a ruined man.'\r\n\r\n\"'Nonsense, old chap!' said the other, slapping him upon the shoulder.\r\n'I've had a nasty facer myself, but--'  That was all I could hear, but\r\nit was enough to set me thinking.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I\r\ntook the chance of speaking to him.\r\n\r\n\"'I wish to have your advice, major,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Small, what is it?' he asked, taking his cheroot from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"'I wanted to ask you, sir,' said I, 'who is the proper person to whom\r\nhidden treasure should be handed over.  I know where half a million\r\nworth lies, and, as I cannot use it myself, I thought perhaps the best\r\nthing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper\r\nauthorities, and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for\r\nme.'\r\n\r\n\"'Half a million, Small?' he gasped, looking hard at me to see if I was\r\nin earnest.\r\n\r\n\"'Quite that, sir,--in jewels and pearls.  It lies there ready for any\r\none.  And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed\r\nand cannot hold property, so that it belongs to the first comer.'\r\n\r\n\"'To government, Small,' he stammered,--'to government.'  But he said\r\nit in a halting fashion, and I knew in my heart that I had got him.\r\n\r\n\"'You think, then, sir, that I should give the information to the\r\nGovernor-General?' said I, quietly.\r\n\r\n\"'Well, well, you must not do anything rash, or that you might repent.\r\nLet me hear all about it, Small.  Give me the facts.'\r\n\r\n\"I told him the whole story, with small changes so that he could not\r\nidentify the places.  When I had finished he stood stock still and full\r\nof thought.  I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a\r\nstruggle going on within him.\r\n\r\n\"'This is a very important matter, Small,' he said, at last. 'You must\r\nnot say a word to any one about it, and I shall see you again soon.'\r\n\r\n\"Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in\r\nthe dead of the night with a lantern.\r\n\r\n\"'I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own\r\nlips, Small,' said he.\r\n\r\n\"I repeated it as I had told it before.\r\n\r\n\"'It rings true, eh?' said he.  'It's good enough to act upon?'\r\n\r\n\"Captain Morstan nodded.\r\n\r\n\"'Look here, Small,' said the major.  'We have been talking it over, my\r\nfriend here and I, and we have come to the conclusion that this secret\r\nof yours is hardly a government matter, after all, but is a private\r\nconcern of your own, which of course you have the power of disposing of\r\nas you think best.  Now, the question is, what price would you ask for\r\nit?  We might be inclined to take it up, and at least look into it, if\r\nwe could agree as to terms.'  He tried to speak in a cool, careless\r\nway, but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, as to that, gentlemen,' I answered, trying also to be cool, but\r\nfeeling as excited as he did, 'there is only one bargain which a man in\r\nmy position can make.  I shall want you to help me to my freedom, and\r\nto help my three companions to theirs. We shall then take you into\r\npartnership, and give you a fifth share to divide between you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Hum!' said he.  'A fifth share!  That is not very tempting.'\r\n\r\n\"'It would come to fifty thousand apiece,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'But how can we gain your freedom?  You know very well that you ask an\r\nimpossibility.'\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing of the sort,' I answered.  'I have thought it all out to the\r\nlast detail.  The only bar to our escape is that we can get no boat fit\r\nfor the voyage, and no provisions to last us for so long a time.  There\r\nare plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would\r\nserve our turn well.  Do you bring one over. We shall engage to get\r\naboard her by night, and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian\r\ncoast you will have done your part of the bargain.'\r\n\r\n\"'If there were only one,' he said.\r\n\r\n\"'None or all,' I answered.  'We have sworn it.  The four of us must\r\nalways act together.'\r\n\r\n\"'You see, Morstan,' said he, 'Small is a man of his word.  He does not\r\nflinch from his friend.  I think we may very well trust him.'\r\n\r\n\"'It's a dirty business,' the other answered.  'Yet, as you say, the\r\nmoney would save our commissions handsomely.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Small,' said the major, 'we must, I suppose, try and meet you.\r\nWe must first, of course, test the truth of your story. Tell me where\r\nthe box is hid, and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India\r\nin the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair.'\r\n\r\n\"'Not so fast,' said I, growing colder as he got hot.  'I must have the\r\nconsent of my three comrades.  I tell you that it is four or none with\r\nus.'\r\n\r\n\"'Nonsense!' he broke in.  'What have three black fellows to do with\r\nour agreement?'\r\n\r\n\"'Black or blue,' said I, 'they are in with me, and we all go together.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, the matter ended by a second meeting, at which Mahomet Singh,\r\nAbdullah Khan, and Dost Akbar were all present.  We talked the matter\r\nover again, and at last we came to an arrangement.  We were to provide\r\nboth the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the\r\nplace in the wall where the treasure was hid.  Major Sholto was to go\r\nto India to test our story.  If he found the box he was to leave it\r\nthere, to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage, which was to\r\nlie off Rutland Island, and to which we were to make our way, and\r\nfinally to return to his duties.  Captain Morstan was then to apply for\r\nleave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final\r\ndivision of the treasure, he taking the major's share as well as his\r\nown.  All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could\r\nthink or the lips utter.  I sat up all night with paper and ink, and by\r\nthe morning I had the two charts all ready, signed with the sign of\r\nfour,--that is, of Abdullah, Akbar, Mahomet, and myself.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, I weary you with my long story, and I know that my\r\nfriend Mr. Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey.  I'll\r\nmake it as short as I can.  The villain Sholto went off to India, but\r\nhe never came back again.  Captain Morstan showed me his name among a\r\nlist of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards.\r\nHis uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the army,\r\nyet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us.  Morstan\r\nwent over to Agra shortly afterwards, and found, as we expected, that\r\nthe treasure was indeed gone.  The scoundrel had stolen it all, without\r\ncarrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret.\r\nFrom that day I lived only for vengeance.  I thought of it by day and I\r\nnursed it by night.  It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with\r\nme.  I cared nothing for the law,--nothing for the gallows.  To escape,\r\nto track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat,--that was my one\r\nthought.  Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my\r\nmind than the slaying of Sholto.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have set my mind on many things in this life, and never one\r\nwhich I did not carry out.  But it was weary years before my time came.\r\nI have told you that I had picked up something of medicine.  One day\r\nwhen Dr. Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was\r\npicked up by a convict-gang in the woods.  He was sick to death, and\r\nhad gone to a lonely place to die.  I took him in hand, though he was\r\nas venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him\r\nall right and able to walk.  He took a kind of fancy to me then, and\r\nwould hardly go back to his woods, but was always hanging about my hut.\r\nI learned a little of his lingo from him, and this made him all the\r\nfonder of me.\r\n\r\n\"Tonga--for that was his name--was a fine boatman, and owned a big,\r\nroomy canoe of his own.  When I found that he was devoted to me and\r\nwould do anything to serve me, I saw my chance of escape. I talked it\r\nover with him.  He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an\r\nold wharf which was never guarded, and there he was to pick me up.  I\r\ngave him directions to have several gourds of water and a lot of yams,\r\ncocoa-nuts, and sweet potatoes.\r\n\r\n\"He was stanch and true, was little Tonga.  No man ever had a more\r\nfaithful mate.  At the night named he had his boat at the wharf.  As it\r\nchanced, however, there was one of the convict-guard down there,--a\r\nvile Pathan who had never missed a chance of insulting and injuring me.\r\nI had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance.  It was as if\r\nfate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left\r\nthe island.  He stood on the bank with his back to me, and his carbine\r\non his shoulder.  I looked about for a stone to beat out his brains\r\nwith, but none could I see.  Then a queer thought came into my head and\r\nshowed me where I could lay my hand on a weapon.  I sat down in the\r\ndarkness and unstrapped my wooden leg.  With three long hops I was on\r\nhim.  He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and\r\nknocked the whole front of his skull in.  You can see the split in the\r\nwood now where I hit him.  We both went down together, for I could not\r\nkeep my balance, but when I got up I found him still lying quiet\r\nenough.  I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea.\r\nTonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and\r\nhis gods.  Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some\r\nAndaman cocoa-nut matting, with which I made a sort of sail.  For ten\r\ndays we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we\r\nwere picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah\r\nwith a cargo of Malay pilgrims.  They were a rum crowd, and Tonga and I\r\nsoon managed to settle down among them.  They had one very good\r\nquality:  they let you alone and asked no questions.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if I were to tell you all the adventures that my little chum and\r\nI went through, you would not thank me, for I would have you here until\r\nthe sun was shining.  Here and there we drifted about the world,\r\nsomething always turning up to keep us from London.  All the time,\r\nhowever, I never lost sight of my purpose. I would dream of Sholto at\r\nnight.  A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep.  At last,\r\nhowever, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England.\r\nI had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to\r\nwork to discover whether he had realized the treasure, or if he still\r\nhad it.  I made friends with someone who could help me,--I name no\r\nnames, for I don't want to get any one else in a hole,--and I soon\r\nfound that he still had the jewels.  Then I tried to get at him in many\r\nways; but he was pretty sly, and had always two prize-fighters, besides\r\nhis sons and his khitmutgar, on guard over him.\r\n\r\n\"One day, however, I got word that he was dying.  I hurried at once to\r\nthe garden, mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that, and,\r\nlooking through the window, I saw him lying in his bed, with his sons\r\non each side of him.  I'd have come through and taken my chance with\r\nthe three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I\r\nknew that he was gone.  I got into his room that same night, though,\r\nand I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he\r\nhad hidden our jewels.  There was not a line, however:  so I came away,\r\nbitter and savage as a man could be.  Before I left I bethought me that\r\nif I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know\r\nthat I had left some mark of our hatred:  so I scrawled down the sign\r\nof the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his\r\nbosom.  It was too much that he should be taken to the grave without\r\nsome token from the men whom he had robbed and befooled.\r\n\r\n\"We earned a living at this time by my exhibiting poor Tonga at fairs\r\nand other such places as the black cannibal.  He would eat raw meat and\r\ndance his war-dance:  so we always had a hatful of pennies after a\r\nday's work.  I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for\r\nsome years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for\r\nthe treasure.  At last, however, came what we had waited for so long.\r\nThe treasure had been found.  It was up at the top of the house, in Mr.\r\nBartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory.  I came at once and had a\r\nlook at the place, but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to\r\nmake my way up to it.  I learned, however, about a trap-door in the\r\nroof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour.  It seemed to me that I\r\ncould manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me\r\nwith a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and\r\nhe soon made his way through the roof, but, as ill luck would have it,\r\nBartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost.  Tonga thought\r\nhe had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by\r\nthe rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock.  Very much\r\nsurprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him\r\nfor a little blood-thirsty imp.  I took the treasure-box and let it\r\ndown, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four\r\nupon the table, to show that the jewels had come back at last to those\r\nwho had most right to them.  Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the\r\nwindow, and made off the way that he had come.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that I have anything else to tell you.  I had heard a\r\nwaterman speak of the speed of Smith's launch the Aurora, so I thought\r\nshe would be a handy craft for our escape.  I engaged with old Smith,\r\nand was to give him a big sum if he got us safe to our ship.  He knew,\r\nno doubt, that there was some screw loose, but he was not in our\r\nsecrets.  All this is the truth, and if I tell it to you, gentlemen, it\r\nis not to amuse you,--for you have not done me a very good turn,--but\r\nit is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold\r\nback nothing, but let all the world know how badly I have myself been\r\nserved by Major Sholto, and how innocent I am of the death of his son.\"\r\n\r\n\"A very remarkable account,\" said Sherlock Holmes.  \"A fitting wind-up\r\nto an extremely interesting case.  There is nothing at all new to me in\r\nthe latter part of your narrative, except that you brought your own\r\nrope.  That I did not know.  By the way, I had hoped that Tonga had\r\nlost all his darts; yet he managed to shoot one at us in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"He had lost them all, sir, except the one which was in his blow-pipe\r\nat the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, of course,\" said Holmes.  \"I had not thought of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any other point which you would like to ask about?\" asked the\r\nconvict, affably.\r\n\r\n\"I think not, thank you,\" my companion answered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Holmes,\" said Athelney Jones, \"You are a man to be humored, and\r\nwe all know that you are a connoisseur of crime, but duty is duty, and\r\nI have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me.  I\r\nshall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under\r\nlock and key.  The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors\r\ndown-stairs.  I am much obliged to you both for your assistance.  Of\r\ncourse you will be wanted at the trial.  Good-night to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, gentlemen both,\" said Jonathan Small.\r\n\r\n\"You first, Small,\" remarked the wary Jones as they left the room.\r\n\"I'll take particular care that you don't club me with your wooden leg,\r\nwhatever you may have done to the gentleman at the Andaman Isles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and there is the end of our little drama,\" I remarked, after we\r\nhad set some time smoking in silence.  \"I fear that it may be the last\r\ninvestigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your\r\nmethods.  Miss Morstan has done me the honor to accept me as a husband\r\nin prospective.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a most dismal groan.  \"I feared as much,\" said he.  \"I really\r\ncannot congratulate you.\"\r\n\r\nI was a little hurt.  \"Have you any reason to be dissatisfied with my\r\nchoice?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all.  I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I\r\never met, and might have been most useful in such work as we have been\r\ndoing.  She had a decided genius that way: witness the way in which she\r\npreserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father.  But\r\nlove is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to\r\nthat true cold reason which I place above all things.  I should never\r\nmarry myself, lest I bias my judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I trust,\" said I, laughing, \"that my judgment may survive the ordeal.\r\nBut you look weary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the reaction is already upon me.  I shall be as limp as a rag for\r\na week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange,\" said I, \"how terms of what in another man I should call\r\nlaziness alternate with your fits of splendid energy and vigor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"there are in me the makings of a very fine loafer\r\nand also of a pretty spry sort of fellow.  I often think of those lines\r\nof old Goethe,--\r\n\r\n  Schade dass die Natur nur EINEN Mensch aus Dir schuf,\r\n  Denn zum wuerdigen Mann war und zum Schelmen der Stoff.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, a propos of this Norwood business, you see that they had,\r\nas I surmised, a confederate in the house, who could be none other than\r\nLal Rao, the butler:  so Jones actually has the undivided honor of\r\nhaving caught one fish in his great haul.\"\r\n\r\n\"The division seems rather unfair,\" I remarked.  \"You have done all the\r\nwork in this business.  I get a wife out of it, Jones gets the credit,\r\npray what remains for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"For me,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"there still remains the\r\ncocaine-bottle.\"  And he stretched his long white hand up for it.\r\n\n", "The Hound of the Baskervilles": "Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save\r\nupon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated\r\nat the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the\r\nstick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a\r\nfine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as\r\na \"Penang lawyer.\" Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly\r\nan inch across. \"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\r\nC.C.H.,\" was engraved upon it, with the date \"1884.\" It was just such a\r\nstick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,\r\nsolid, and reassuring.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of\r\nmy occupation.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back\r\nof your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front of\r\nme,\" said he. \"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our visitor's\r\nstick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no\r\nnotion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.\r\nLet me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\r\ncompanion, \"that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,\r\nwell-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their\r\nappreciation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country\r\npractitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so\r\nknocked about that I can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.\r\nThe thick-iron ferrule is worn down, so it is evident that he has done a\r\ngreat amount of walking with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly sound!\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"And then again, there is the 'friends of the C.C.H.' I should guess\r\nthat to be the Something Hunt, the local hunt to whose members he has\r\npossibly given some surgical assistance, and which has made him a small\r\npresentation in return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Watson, you excel yourself,\" said Holmes, pushing back his\r\nchair and lighting a cigarette. \"I am bound to say that in all the\r\naccounts which you have been so good as to give of my own small\r\nachievements you have habitually underrated your own abilities. It may\r\nbe that you are not yourself luminous, but you are a conductor of\r\nlight. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of\r\nstimulating it. I confess, my dear fellow, that I am very much in your\r\ndebt.\"\r\n\r\nHe had never said as much before, and I must admit that his words gave\r\nme keen pleasure, for I had often been piqued by his indifference to my\r\nadmiration and to the attempts which I had made to give publicity to\r\nhis methods. I was proud, too, to think that I had so far mastered his\r\nsystem as to apply it in a way which earned his approval. He now took\r\nthe stick from my hands and examined it for a few minutes with his naked\r\neyes. Then with an expression of interest he laid down his cigarette,\r\nand carrying the cane to the window, he looked over it again with a\r\nconvex lens.\r\n\r\n\"Interesting, though elementary,\" said he as he returned to his\r\nfavourite corner of the settee. \"There are certainly one or two\r\nindications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\r\ndeductions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has anything escaped me?\" I asked with some self-importance. \"I trust\r\nthat there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\r\nerroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that\r\nin noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.\r\nNot that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a\r\ncountry practitioner. And he walks a good deal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I was right.\"\r\n\r\n\"To that extent.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that was all.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, my dear Watson, not all--by no means all. I would suggest, for\r\nexample, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from a\r\nhospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are placed\r\nbefore that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally suggest\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right.\"\r\n\r\n\"The probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\r\nworking hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\r\nconstruction of this unknown visitor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross\r\nHospital,' what further inferences may we draw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!\"\r\n\r\n\"I can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised\r\nin town before going to the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it\r\nin this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a\r\npresentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him\r\na pledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer\r\nwithdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice\r\nfor himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has\r\nbeen a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,\r\nstretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\r\noccasion of the change?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly seems probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the\r\nhospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could\r\nhold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.\r\nWhat was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he\r\ncould only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician--little more\r\nthan a senior student. And he left five years ago--the date is on the\r\nstick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into\r\nthin air, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,\r\namiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite\r\ndog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and\r\nsmaller than a mastiff.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed incredulously as Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his settee and\r\nblew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"As to the latter part, I have no means of checking you,\" said I, \"but\r\nat least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the\r\nman's age and professional career.\" From my small medical shelf I took\r\ndown the Medical Directory and turned up the name. There were several\r\nMortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. I read his record\r\naloud.\r\n\r\n        \"Mortimer, James, M.R.C.S., 1882, Grimpen, Dartmoor, Devon.\r\n        House-surgeon, from 1882 to 1884, at Charing Cross Hospital.\r\n        Winner of the Jackson prize for Comparative Pathology,\r\n        with essay entitled 'Is Disease a Reversion?'  Corresponding\r\n        member of the Swedish Pathological Society.  Author of\r\n        'Some Freaks of Atavism' (Lancet 1882).  'Do We Progress?'\r\n        (Journal of Psychology, March, 1883).  Medical Officer\r\n        for the parishes of Grimpen, Thorsley, and High Barrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"No mention of that local hunt, Watson,\" said Holmes with a mischievous\r\nsmile, \"but a country doctor, as you very astutely observed. I think\r\nthat I am fairly justified in my inferences. As to the adjectives, I\r\nsaid, if I remember right, amiable, unambitious, and absent-minded.\r\nIt is my experience that it is only an amiable man in this world who\r\nreceives testimonials, only an unambitious one who abandons a London\r\ncareer for the country, and only an absent-minded one who leaves his\r\nstick and not his visiting-card after waiting an hour in your room.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Has been in the habit of carrying this stick behind his master. Being a\r\nheavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of\r\nhis teeth are very plainly visible. The dog's jaw, as shown in the space\r\nbetween these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not\r\nbroad enough for a mastiff. It may have been--yes, by Jove, it is a\r\ncurly-haired spaniel.\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess\r\nof the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I\r\nglanced up in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very\r\ndoor-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you,\r\nWatson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be\r\nof assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when\r\nyou hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you\r\nknow not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man\r\nof science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected\r\na typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a\r\nlong nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,\r\nset closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of\r\ngold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly\r\nfashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though\r\nyoung, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward\r\nthrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he\r\nentered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran\r\ntowards it with an exclamation of joy. \"I am so very glad,\" said he.\r\n\"I was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\r\nwould not lose that stick for the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"A presentation, I see,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Charing Cross Hospital?\"\r\n\r\n\"From one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear, dear, that's bad!\" said Holmes, shaking his head.\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. \"Why was\r\nit bad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that you have disarranged our little deductions. Your marriage,\r\nyou say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. I married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of\r\na consulting practice. It was necessary to make a home of my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,\" said Holmes. \"And now,\r\nDr. James Mortimer--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mister, sir, Mister--a humble M.R.C.S.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a man of precise mind, evidently.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dabbler in science, Mr. Holmes, a picker up of shells on the shores\r\nof the great unknown ocean. I presume that it is Mr. Sherlock Holmes\r\nwhom I am addressing and not--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, this is my friend Dr. Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Glad to meet you, sir. I have heard your name mentioned in connection\r\nwith that of your friend. You interest me very much, Mr. Holmes. I\r\nhad hardly expected so dolichocephalic a skull or such well-marked\r\nsupra-orbital development. Would you have any objection to my running my\r\nfinger along your parietal fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until\r\nthe original is available, would be an ornament to any anthropological\r\nmuseum. It is not my intention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet\r\nyour skull.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair. \"You are an\r\nenthusiast in your line of thought, I perceive, sir, as I am in\r\nmine,\" said he. \"I observe from your forefinger that you make your own\r\ncigarettes. Have no hesitation in lighting one.\"\r\n\r\nThe man drew out paper and tobacco and twirled the one up in the other\r\nwith surprising dexterity. He had long, quivering fingers as agile and\r\nrestless as the antennae of an insect.\r\n\r\nHolmes was silent, but his little darting glances showed me the interest\r\nwhich he took in our curious companion. \"I presume, sir,\" said he at\r\nlast, \"that it was not merely for the purpose of examining my skull that\r\nyou have done me the honour to call here last night and again today?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, no; though I am happy to have had the opportunity of doing\r\nthat as well. I came to you, Mr. Holmes, because I recognized that I am\r\nmyself an unpractical man and because I am suddenly confronted with a\r\nmost serious and extraordinary problem. Recognizing, as I do, that you\r\nare the second highest expert in Europe--\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?\" asked\r\nHolmes with some asperity.\r\n\r\n\"To the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon\r\nmust always appeal strongly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then had you not better consult him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man\r\nof affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I\r\nhave not inadvertently--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a little,\" said Holmes. \"I think, Dr. Mortimer, you would do\r\nwisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the\r\nexact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.\"\r\n\n\"I have in my pocket a manuscript,\" said Dr. James Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"I observed it as you entered the room,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"It is an old manuscript.\"\r\n\r\n\"Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you say that, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time\r\nthat you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give\r\nthe date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read\r\nmy little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.\"\r\n\r\n\"The exact date is 1742.\" Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.\r\n\"This family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,\r\nwhose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much\r\nexcitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as\r\nwell as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,\r\npractical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this\r\ndocument very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end\r\nas did eventually overtake him.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon\r\nhis knee. \"You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s\r\nand the short. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix\r\nthe date.\"\r\n\r\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At\r\nthe head was written: \"Baskerville Hall,\" and below in large, scrawling\r\nfigures: \"1742.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears to be a statement of some sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the\r\nBaskerville family.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I understand that it is something more modern and practical upon\r\nwhich you wish to consult me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided\r\nwithin twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and is intimately\r\nconnected with the affair. With your permission I will read it to you.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and\r\nclosed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer turned the\r\nmanuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following\r\ncurious, old-world narrative:\r\n\r\n        \"Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there\r\n        have been many statements, yet as I come in a direct\r\n        line from Hugo Baskerville, and as I had the story from\r\n        my father, who also had it from his, I have set it down\r\n        with all belief that it occurred even as is here set\r\n        forth.  And I would have you believe, my sons, that the\r\n        same Justice which punishes sin may also most graciously\r\n        forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy but that by prayer\r\n        and repentance it may be removed.  Learn then from this\r\n        story not to fear the fruits of the past, but rather to\r\n        be circumspect in the future, that those foul passions\r\n        whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not\r\n        again be loosed to our undoing.\r\n\r\n        \"Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the\r\n        history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most\r\n        earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of\r\n        Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be\r\n        gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless\r\n        man.  This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned,\r\n        seeing that saints have never flourished in those parts,\r\n        but there was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour\r\n        which made his name a by-word through the West.  It\r\n        chanced that this Hugo came to love (if, indeed, so dark\r\n        a passion may be known under so bright a name) the daughter\r\n        of a yeoman who held lands near the Baskerville estate.\r\n        But the young maiden, being discreet and of good repute,\r\n        would ever avoid him, for she feared his evil name.  So\r\n        it came to pass that one Michaelmas this Hugo, with five\r\n        or six of his idle and wicked companions, stole down upon\r\n        the farm and carried off the maiden, her father and\r\n        brothers being from home, as he well knew.  When they had\r\n        brought her to the Hall the maiden was placed in an upper\r\n        chamber, while Hugo and his friends sat down to a long\r\n        carouse, as was their nightly custom.  Now, the poor lass\r\n        upstairs was like to have her wits turned at the singing\r\n        and shouting and terrible oaths which came up to her from\r\n        below, for they say that the words used by Hugo Baskerville,\r\n        when he was in wine, were such as might blast the man who\r\n        said them.  At last in the stress of her fear she did that\r\n        which might have daunted the bravest or most active man,\r\n        for by the aid of the growth of ivy which covered (and\r\n        still covers) the south wall she came down from under the\r\n        eaves, and so homeward across the moor, there being three\r\n        leagues betwixt the Hall and her father's farm.\r\n\r\n        \"It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his\r\n        guests to carry food and drink--with other worse things,\r\n        perchance--to his captive, and so found the cage empty\r\n        and the bird escaped.  Then, as it would seem, he became\r\n        as one that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs\r\n        into the dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table,\r\n        flagons and trenchers flying before him, and he cried\r\n        aloud before all the company that he would that very\r\n        night render his body and soul to the Powers of Evil if\r\n        he might but overtake the wench.  And while the revellers\r\n        stood aghast at the fury of the man, one more wicked or,\r\n        it may be, more drunken than the rest, cried out that\r\n        they should put the hounds upon her.  Whereat Hugo ran\r\n        from the house, crying to his grooms that they should\r\n        saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and giving the\r\n        hounds a kerchief of the maid's, he swung them to the\r\n        line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the moor.\r\n\r\n        \"Now, for some space the revellers stood agape, unable\r\n        to understand all that had been done in such haste.  But\r\n        anon their bemused wits awoke to the nature of the deed\r\n        which was like to be done upon the moorlands.  Everything\r\n        was now in an uproar, some calling for their pistols,\r\n        some for their horses, and some for another flask of\r\n        wine.  But at length some sense came back to their crazed\r\n        minds, and the whole of them, thirteen in number, took\r\n        horse and started in pursuit.  The moon shone clear above\r\n        them, and they rode swiftly abreast, taking that course\r\n        which the maid must needs have taken if she were to reach\r\n        her own home.\r\n\r\n        \"They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the\r\n        night shepherds upon the moorlands, and they cried to\r\n        him to know if he had seen the hunt.  And the man, as\r\n        the story goes, was so crazed with fear that he could\r\n        scarce speak, but at last he said that he had indeed seen\r\n        the unhappy maiden, with the hounds upon her track.  'But\r\n        I have seen more than that,' said he, 'for Hugo Baskerville\r\n        passed me upon his black mare, and there ran mute behind\r\n        him such a hound of hell as God forbid should ever be at\r\n        my heels.'  So the drunken squires cursed the shepherd\r\n        and rode onward.  But soon their skins turned cold, for\r\n        there came a galloping across the moor, and the black\r\n        mare, dabbled with white froth, went past with trailing\r\n        bridle and empty saddle.  Then the revellers rode close\r\n        together, for a great fear was on them, but they still\r\n        followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone,\r\n        would have been right glad to have turned his horse's\r\n        head.  Riding slowly in this fashion they came at last\r\n        upon the hounds.  These, though known for their valour\r\n        and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the\r\n        head of a deep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the\r\n        moor, some slinking away and some, with starting hackles\r\n        and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow valley before them.\r\n\r\n        \"The company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you\r\n        may guess, than when they started.  The most of them\r\n        would by no means advance, but three of them, the boldest,\r\n        or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down the goyal.\r\n        Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of\r\n        those great stones, still to be seen there, which were\r\n        set by certain forgotten peoples in the days of old.\r\n        The moon was shining bright upon the clearing, and there\r\n        in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had fallen,\r\n        dead of fear and of fatigue.  But it was not the sight\r\n        of her body, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo\r\n        Baskerville lying near her, which raised the hair upon\r\n        the heads of these three dare-devil roysterers, but it\r\n        was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his throat,\r\n        there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped\r\n        like a hound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal\r\n        eye has rested upon.  And even as they looked the thing\r\n        tore the throat out of Hugo Baskerville, on which, as it\r\n        turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws upon them, the\r\n        three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still\r\n        screaming, across the moor.  One, it is said, died that\r\n        very night of what he had seen, and the other twain were\r\n        but broken men for the rest of their days.\r\n\r\n        \"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound\r\n        which is said to have plagued the family so sorely ever\r\n        since.  If I have set it down it is because that which\r\n        is clearly known hath less terror than that which is but\r\n        hinted at and guessed.  Nor can it be denied that many\r\n        of the family have been unhappy in their deaths, which\r\n        have been sudden, bloody, and mysterious.  Yet may we\r\n        shelter ourselves in the infinite goodness of Providence,\r\n        which would not forever punish the innocent beyond that\r\n        third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy\r\n        Writ.  To that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend\r\n        you, and I counsel you by way of caution to forbear from\r\n        crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of\r\n        evil are exalted.\r\n\r\n        \"[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John,\r\n        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their\r\n        sister Elizabeth.]\"\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed\r\nhis spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not find it interesting?\"\r\n\r\n\"To a collector of fairy tales.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This\r\nis the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short\r\naccount of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville\r\nwhich occurred a few days before that date.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend leaned a little forward and his expression became intent. Our\r\nvisitor readjusted his glasses and began:\r\n\r\n        \"The recent sudden death of Sir Charles Baskerville, whose\r\n        name has been mentioned as the probable Liberal candidate\r\n        for Mid-Devon at the next election, has cast a gloom over\r\n        the county.  Though Sir Charles had resided at Baskerville\r\n        Hall for a comparatively short period his amiability of\r\n        character and extreme generosity had won the affection\r\n        and respect of all who had been brought into contact with\r\n        him.  In these days of nouveaux riches it is refreshing\r\n        to find a case where the scion of an old county family\r\n        which has fallen upon evil days is able to make his own\r\n        fortune and to bring it back with him to restore the\r\n        fallen grandeur of his line.  Sir Charles, as is well known,\r\n        made large sums of money in South African speculation.\r\n        More wise than those who go on until the wheel turns\r\n        against them, he realized his gains and returned to England\r\n        with them.  It is only two years since he took up his\r\n        residence at Baskerville Hall, and it is common talk how\r\n        large were those schemes of reconstruction and improvement\r\n        which have been interrupted by his death.  Being himself\r\n        childless, it was his openly expressed desire that the\r\n        whole countryside should, within his own lifetime, profit\r\n        by his good fortune, and many will have personal reasons\r\n        for bewailing his untimely end.  His generous donations\r\n        to local and county charities have been frequently\r\n        chronicled in these columns.\r\n\r\n        \"The circumstances connected with the death of Sir Charles\r\n        cannot be said to have been entirely cleared up by the\r\n        inquest, but at least enough has been done to dispose of\r\n        those rumours to which local superstition has given rise.\r\n        There is no reason whatever to suspect foul play, or to\r\n        imagine that death could be from any but natural causes.\r\n        Sir Charles was a widower, and a man who may be said to\r\n        have been in some ways of an eccentric habit of mind.\r\n        In spite of his considerable wealth he was simple in his\r\n        personal tastes, and his indoor servants at Baskerville\r\n        Hall consisted of a married couple named Barrymore, the\r\n        husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.\r\n        Their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,\r\n        tends to show that Sir Charles's health has for some time\r\n        been impaired, and points especially to some affection\r\n        of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,\r\n        breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.\r\n        Dr. James Mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of\r\n        the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.\r\n\r\n        \"The facts of the case are simple.  Sir Charles Baskerville\r\n        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking\r\n        down the famous yew alley of Baskerville Hall.  The evidence\r\n        of the Barrymores shows that this had been his custom.\r\n        On the fourth of May Sir Charles had declared his intention\r\n        of starting next day for London, and had ordered Barrymore\r\n        to prepare his luggage.  That night he went out as usual\r\n        for his nocturnal walk, in the course of which he was in\r\n        the habit of smoking a cigar.  He never returned.  At\r\n        twelve o'clock Barrymore, finding the hall door still open,\r\n        became alarmed, and, lighting a lantern, went in search\r\n        of his master.  The day had been wet, and Sir Charles's\r\n        footmarks were easily traced down the alley.  Halfway down\r\n        this walk there is a gate which leads out on to the moor.\r\n        There were indications that Sir Charles had stood for some\r\n        little time here.  He then proceeded down the alley, and\r\n        it was at the far end of it that his body was discovered.\r\n        One fact which has not been explained is the statement\r\n        of Barrymore that his master's footprints altered their\r\n        character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and\r\n        that he appeared from thence onward to have been walking\r\n        upon his toes.  One Murphy, a gipsy horse-dealer, was on\r\n        the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears\r\n        by his own confession to have been the worse for drink.\r\n        He declares that he heard cries but is unable to state\r\n        from what direction they came.  No signs of violence were\r\n        to be discovered upon Sir Charles's person, and though\r\n        the doctor's evidence pointed to an almost incredible\r\n        facial distortion--so great that Dr. Mortimer refused at\r\n        first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient\r\n        who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom\r\n        which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from\r\n        cardiac exhaustion.  This explanation was borne out by\r\n        the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing\r\n        organic disease, and the coroner's jury returned a\r\n        verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.  It is\r\n        well that this is so, for it is obviously of the utmost\r\n        importance that Sir Charles's heir should settle at the\r\n        Hall and continue the good work which has been so sadly\r\n        interrupted.  Had the prosaic finding of the coroner not\r\n        finally put an end to the romantic stories which have been\r\n        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been\r\n        difficult to find a tenant for Baskerville Hall.  It is\r\n        understood that the next of kin is Mr. Henry Baskerville,\r\n        if he be still alive, the son of Sir Charles Baskerville's\r\n        younger brother.  The young man when last heard of was\r\n        in America, and inquiries are being instituted with a\r\n        view to informing him of his good fortune.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. \"Those\r\nare the public facts, Mr. Holmes, in connection with the death of Sir\r\nCharles Baskerville.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must thank you,\" said Sherlock Holmes, \"for calling my attention to a\r\ncase which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed\r\nsome newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied\r\nby that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige\r\nthe Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases. This\r\narticle, you say, contains all the public facts?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me have the private ones.\" He leaned back, put his finger-tips\r\ntogether, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.\r\n\r\n\"In doing so,\" said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some\r\nstrong emotion, \"I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.\r\nMy motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man of\r\nscience shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming\r\nto indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that\r\nBaskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted\r\nif anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.\r\nFor both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather\r\nless than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with\r\nyou there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\r\n\r\n\"The moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other\r\nare thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal of\r\nSir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of Lafter\r\nHall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of\r\neducation within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the\r\nchance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests\r\nin science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information\r\nfrom South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\r\ndiscussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\r\n\r\n\"Within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that\r\nSir Charles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had\r\ntaken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart--so much\r\nso that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce\r\nhim to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to\r\nyou, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung\r\nhis family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of\r\nhis ancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\r\nconstantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me\r\nwhether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange\r\ncreature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put\r\nto me several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"I can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three\r\nweeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had\r\ndescended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw\r\nhis eyes fix themselves over my shoulder and stare past me with an\r\nexpression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just\r\ntime to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black\r\ncalf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he\r\nthat I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been\r\nand look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared\r\nto make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\r\nevening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he\r\nhad shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to\r\nyou when first I came. I mention this small episode because it assumes\r\nsome importance in view of the tragedy which followed, but I was\r\nconvinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his\r\nexcitement had no justification.\r\n\r\n\"It was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His\r\nheart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived,\r\nhowever chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a\r\nserious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the\r\ndistractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a\r\nmutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the\r\nsame opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.\r\n\r\n\"On the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made\r\nthe discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was\r\nsitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of\r\nthe event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned\r\nat the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the yew alley, I saw the\r\nspot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the\r\nchange in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there\r\nwere no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\r\nfinally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until\r\nmy arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug\r\ninto the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to\r\nsuch an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was\r\ncertainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was\r\nmade by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces\r\nupon the ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did--some\r\nlittle distance off, but fresh and clear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Footprints?\"\r\n\r\n\"Footprints.\"\r\n\r\n\"A man's or a woman's?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank\r\nalmost to a whisper as he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!\"\r\n\nI confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill\r\nin the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by\r\nthat which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his\r\neyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n\"You saw this?\"\r\n\r\n\"As clearly as I see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you said nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"What was the use?\"\r\n\r\n\"How was it that no one else saw it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them\r\na thought. I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this\r\nlegend.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many sheep-dogs on the moor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say it was large?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enormous.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it had not approached the body?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of night was it?'\r\n\r\n\"Damp and raw.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not actually raining?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the alley like?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\r\nimpenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything between the hedges and the walk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there any other opening?\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"So that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the\r\nhouse or else to enter it by the moor-gate?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had Sir Charles reached this?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; he lay about fifty yards from it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, tell me, Dr. Mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you\r\nsaw were on the path and not on the grass?\"\r\n\r\n\"No marks could show on the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\r\nmoor-gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\r\nclosed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Closed and padlocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"How high was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"About four feet high.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then anyone could have got over it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?\"\r\n\r\n\"None in particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heaven! Did no one examine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I examined, myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And found nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for\r\nfive or ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the\r\nmarks?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could\r\ndiscern no others.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n\"If I had only been there!\" he cried. \"It is evidently a case of\r\nextraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to\r\nthe scientific expert. That gravel page upon which I might have read so\r\nmuch has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs\r\nof curious peasants. Oh, Dr. Mortimer, Dr. Mortimer, to think that you\r\nshould not have called me in! You have indeed much to answer for.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not call you in, Mr. Holmes, without disclosing these facts to\r\nthe world, and I have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.\r\nBesides, besides--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you hesitate?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of\r\ndetectives is helpless.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that the thing is supernatural?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not positively say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but you evidently think it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since the tragedy, Mr. Holmes, there have come to my ears several\r\nincidents which are hard to reconcile with the settled order of Nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"For example?\"\r\n\r\n\"I find that before the terrible event occurred several people had seen\r\na creature upon the moor which corresponds with this Baskerville demon,\r\nand which could not possibly be any animal known to science. They all\r\nagreed that it was a huge creature, luminous, ghastly, and spectral. I\r\nhave cross-examined these men, one of them a hard-headed countryman,\r\none a farrier, and one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of\r\nthis dreadful apparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the\r\nlegend. I assure you that there is a reign of terror in the district,\r\nand that it is a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what to believe.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders. \"I have hitherto confined my\r\ninvestigations to this world,\" said he. \"In a modest way I have combated\r\nevil, but to take on the Father of Evil himself would, perhaps, be too\r\nambitious a task. Yet you must admit that the footmark is material.\"\r\n\r\n\"The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and\r\nyet he was diabolical as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,\r\nDr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come\r\nto consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless\r\nto investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say that I desired you to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, how can I assist you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who\r\narrives at Waterloo Station\"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch--\"in\r\nexactly one hour and a quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"He being the heir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman\r\nand found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which\r\nhave reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak now not\r\nas a medical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no other claimant, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was Rodger\r\nBaskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir Charles was\r\nthe elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father of this lad\r\nHenry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family. He came of\r\nthe old masterful Baskerville strain and was the very image, they tell\r\nme, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot to hold\r\nhim, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow fever.\r\nHenry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five minutes\r\nI meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he arrived at\r\nSouthampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you advise me to\r\ndo with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every Baskerville\r\nwho goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if Sir Charles\r\ncould have spoken with me before his death he would have warned me\r\nagainst bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir to great\r\nwealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that the\r\nprosperity of the whole poor, bleak countryside depends upon his\r\npresence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will\r\ncrash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I\r\nshould be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter, and\r\nthat is why I bring the case before you and ask for your advice.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes considered for a little time.\r\n\r\n\"Put into plain words, the matter is this,\" said he. \"In your opinion\r\nthere is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for a\r\nBaskerville--that is your opinion?\"\r\n\r\n\"At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence\r\nthat this may be so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it could\r\nwork the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A devil\r\nwith merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too inconceivable\r\na thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would probably\r\ndo if you were brought into personal contact with these things. Your\r\nadvice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man will be as safe\r\nin Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty minutes. What would you\r\nrecommend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is\r\nscratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my\r\nmind about the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take you to make up your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock tomorrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be\r\nmuch obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be\r\nof help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do so, Mr. Holmes.\" He scribbled the appointment on his\r\nshirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\r\nfashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\r\n\r\n\"Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles\r\nBaskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Three people did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did any see it after?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not heard of any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Good-morning.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction\r\nwhich meant that he had a congenial task before him.\r\n\r\n\"Going out, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless I can help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for\r\naid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view.\r\nWhen you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the\r\nstrongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make\r\nit convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad\r\nto compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has\r\nbeen submitted to us this morning.\"\r\n\r\nI knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend\r\nin those hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed\r\nevery particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced\r\none against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were\r\nessential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and\r\ndid not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine o'clock\r\nwhen I found myself in the sitting-room once more.\r\n\r\nMy first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,\r\nfor the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon\r\nthe table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at\r\nrest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me\r\nby the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision\r\nof Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black\r\nclay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\r\n\r\n\"Caught cold, Watson?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's this poisonous atmosphere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thick! It is intolerable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I perceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, but how?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed at my bewildered expression. \"There is a delightful freshness\r\nabout you, Watson, which makes it a pleasure to exercise any small\r\npowers which I possess at your expense. A gentleman goes forth on a\r\nshowery and miry day. He returns immaculate in the evening with the\r\ngloss still on his hat and his boots. He has been a fixture therefore\r\nall day. He is not a man with intimate friends. Where, then, could he\r\nhave been? Is it not obvious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is rather obvious.\"\r\n\r\n\"The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever\r\nobserves. Where do you think that I have been?\"\r\n\r\n\"A fixture also.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire.\"\r\n\r\n\"In spirit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. My body has remained in this armchair and has, I regret\r\nto observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an\r\nincredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to Stamford's\r\nfor the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my spirit has\r\nhovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could find my way\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"A large-scale map, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very large.\"\r\n\r\nHe unrolled one section and held it over his knee. \"Here you have the\r\nparticular district which concerns us. That is Baskerville Hall in the\r\nmiddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"With a wood round it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. I fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must\r\nstretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right\r\nof it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of Grimpen,\r\nwhere our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a radius of\r\nfive miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.\r\nHere is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. There is\r\na house indicated here which may be the residence of the\r\nnaturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are two\r\nmoorland farmhouses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles away the\r\ngreat convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these scattered\r\npoints extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is the stage\r\nupon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play\r\nit again.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be a wild place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a\r\nhand in the affairs of men--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are\r\ntwo questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime\r\nhas been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was\r\nit committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should be correct,\r\nand we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature,\r\nthere is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all\r\nother hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we'll shut\r\nthat window again, if you don't mind. It is a singular thing, but I find\r\nthat a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I have\r\nnot pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is\r\nthe logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case over in\r\nyour mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very bewildering.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of\r\ndistinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example. What\r\ndo you make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of\r\nthe alley.\"\r\n\r\n\"He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a\r\nman walk on tiptoe down the alley?\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,\r\nrunning until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"Running from what?\"\r\n\r\n\"There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed\r\nwith fear before ever he began to run.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the moor.\r\nIf that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had lost his\r\nwits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If the\r\ngipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the\r\ndirection where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom was he\r\nwaiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley\r\nrather than in his own house?\"\r\n\r\n\"You think that he was waiting for someone?\"\r\n\r\n\"The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an evening\r\nstroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is it natural\r\nthat he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr. Mortimer, with more\r\npractical sense than I should have given him credit for, deduced from\r\nthe cigar ash?\"\r\n\r\n\"But he went out every evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. On\r\nthe contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night he\r\nwaited there. It was the night before he made his departure for London.\r\nThe thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I ask you to\r\nhand me my violin, and we will postpone all further thought upon this\r\nbusiness until we have had the advantage of meeting Dr. Mortimer and Sir\r\nHenry Baskerville in the morning.\"\r\n\nOur breakfast table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\r\ndressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to\r\ntheir appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer\r\nwas shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small,\r\nalert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,\r\nwith thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a\r\nruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who\r\nhas spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something\r\nin his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\r\nthe gentleman.\r\n\r\n\"This is Sir Henry Baskerville,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said he, \"and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\nthat if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning\r\nI should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out\r\nlittle puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking\r\nout than I am able to give it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have\r\nyourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.\r\nIt was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nHe laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of\r\ncommon quality, grayish in colour. The address, \"Sir Henry Baskerville,\r\nNorthumberland Hotel,\" was printed in rough characters; the post-mark\r\n\"Charing Cross,\" and the date of posting the preceding evening.\r\n\r\n\"Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?\" asked\r\nHolmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\r\n\r\n\"No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I had been staying with a friend,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"There was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.\" Out\r\nof the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.\r\nThis he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle of it\r\na single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed\r\nwords upon it. It ran:\r\n\r\n        As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.\r\n\r\nThe word \"moor\" only was printed in ink.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Sir Henry Baskerville, \"perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\r\nHolmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes\r\nso much interest in my affairs?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is\r\nnothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced\r\nthat the business is supernatural.\"\r\n\r\n\"What business?\" asked Sir Henry sharply. \"It seems to me that all you\r\ngentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I\r\npromise you that,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"We will confine ourselves\r\nfor the present with your permission to this very interesting document,\r\nwhich must have been put together and posted yesterday evening. Have you\r\nyesterday's Times, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is here in the corner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the leading\r\narticles?\" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the\r\ncolumns. \"Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an\r\nextract from it.\r\n\r\n     'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special\r\n     trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a\r\n     protective tariff, but it stands to reason that such\r\n     legislation must in the long run keep away wealth from the\r\n     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the\r\n     general conditions of life in this island.'\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that, Watson?\" cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing\r\nhis hands together with satisfaction. \"Don't you think that is an\r\nadmirable sentiment?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and\r\nSir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind,\" said he,\r\n\"but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that note is\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir\r\nHenry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear\r\nthat even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I confess that I see no connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that\r\nthe one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,'\r\n'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence\r\nthese words have been taken?\"\r\n\r\n\"By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!\" cried Sir Henry.\r\n\r\n\"If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep\r\naway' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now--so it is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have imagined,\"\r\nsaid Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. \"I could understand\r\nanyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should\r\nname which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one\r\nof the most remarkable things which I have ever known. How did you do\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that\r\nof an Esquimau?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The\r\nsupra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally obvious.\r\nThere is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded bourgeois type\r\nof a Times article and the slovenly print of an evening half-penny paper\r\nas there could be between your negro and your Esquimau. The detection of\r\ntypes is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special\r\nexpert in crime, though I confess that once when I was very young I\r\nconfused the Leeds Mercury with the Western Morning News. But a Times\r\nleader is entirely distinctive, and these words could have been taken\r\nfrom nothing else. As it was done yesterday the strong probability was\r\nthat we should find the words in yesterday's issue.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes,\" said Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville, \"someone cut out this message with a scissors--\"\r\n\r\n\"Nail-scissors,\" said Holmes. \"You can see that it was a very\r\nshort-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over 'keep\r\naway.'\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\r\nshort-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--\"\r\n\r\n\"Gum,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor' should\r\nhave been written?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple\r\nand might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in\r\nthis message, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been\r\ntaken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough\r\ncharacters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands\r\nbut those of the highly educated. We may take it, therefore, that\r\nthe letter was composed by an educated man who wished to pose as an\r\nuneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own writing suggests that\r\nthat writing might be known, or come to be known, by you. Again, you\r\nwill observe that the words are not gummed on in an accurate line, but\r\nthat some are much higher than others. 'Life,' for example is quite out\r\nof its proper place. That may point to carelessness or it may point to\r\nagitation and hurry upon the part of the cutter. On the whole I incline\r\nto the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it\r\nis unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. If he\r\nwere in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be\r\nin a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach\r\nSir Henry before he would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an\r\ninterruption--and from whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,\" said Dr.\r\nMortimer.\r\n\r\n\"Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose\r\nthe most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination, but we\r\nhave always some material basis on which to start our speculation. Now,\r\nyou would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am almost certain that this\r\naddress has been written in a hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"How in the world can you say that?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink\r\nhave given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a single\r\nword and has run dry three times in a short address, showing that there\r\nwas very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is\r\nseldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two\r\nmust be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink and the hotel pen, where\r\nit is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have very little hesitation\r\nin saying that could we examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels\r\naround Charing Cross until we found the remains of the mutilated Times\r\nleader we could lay our hands straight upon the person who sent this\r\nsingular message. Halloa! Halloa! What's this?\"\r\n\r\nHe was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were\r\npasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said he, throwing it down. \"It is a blank half-sheet of\r\npaper, without even a water-mark upon it. I think we have drawn as much\r\nas we can from this curious letter; and now, Sir Henry, has anything\r\nelse of interest happened to you since you have been in London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, Mr. Holmes. I think not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not observed anyone follow or watch you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I seem to have walked right into the thick of a dime novel,\" said our\r\nvisitor. \"Why in thunder should anyone follow or watch me?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are coming to that. You have nothing else to report to us before we\r\ngo into this matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth\r\nreporting.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry smiled. \"I don't know much of British life yet, for I have\r\nspent nearly all my time in the States and in Canada. But I hope that to\r\nlose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have lost one of your boots?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"it is only mislaid. You will find\r\nit when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes\r\nwith trifles of this kind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Holmes, \"however foolish the incident may seem. You have\r\nlost one of your boots, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,\r\nand there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the\r\nchap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair\r\nlast night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?\"\r\n\r\n\"They were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put\r\nthem out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went out\r\nat once and bought a pair of boots?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me.\r\nYou see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and\r\nit may be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among\r\nother things I bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and\r\nhad one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\"I confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long\r\nbefore the missing boot is found.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, now, gentlemen,\" said the baronet with decision, \"it seems to me\r\nthat I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is time\r\nthat you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all\r\ndriving at.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your request is a very reasonable one,\" Holmes answered. \"Dr. Mortimer,\r\nI think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it\r\nto us.\"\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket\r\nand presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.\r\nSir Henry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an\r\noccasional exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance,\" said\r\nhe when the long narrative was finished. \"Of course, I've heard of the\r\nhound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet story of the family,\r\nthough I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my\r\nuncle's death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't\r\nget it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether\r\nit's a case for a policeman or a clergyman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I suppose\r\nthat fits into its place.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on\r\nupon the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\n\"And also,\" said Holmes, \"that someone is not ill-disposed towards you,\r\nsince they warn you of danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to you,\r\nDr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several\r\ninteresting alternatives. But the practical point which we now have to\r\ndecide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to\r\nBaskerville Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I not go?\"\r\n\r\n\"There seems to be danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from\r\nhuman beings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is what we have to find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.\r\nHolmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to\r\nthe home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final answer.\"\r\nHis dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as he spoke.\r\nIt was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was not extinct\r\nin this their last representative. \"Meanwhile,\" said he, \"I have hardly\r\nhad time to think over all that you have told me. It's a big thing for a\r\nman to have to understand and to decide at one sitting. I should like\r\nto have a quiet hour by myself to make up my mind. Now, look here, Mr.\r\nHolmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am going back right away to my\r\nhotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr. Watson, come round and lunch\r\nwith us at two. I'll be able to tell you more clearly then how this\r\nthing strikes me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that convenient to you, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may expect us. Shall I have a cab called?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd prefer to walk, for this affair has flurried me rather.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll join you in a walk, with pleasure,\" said his companion.\r\n\r\n\"Then we meet again at two o'clock. Au revoir, and good-morning!\"\r\n\r\nWe heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the\r\nfront door. In an instant Holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to\r\nthe man of action.\r\n\r\n\"Your hat and boots, Watson, quick! Not a moment to lose!\" He rushed\r\ninto his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds\r\nin a frock-coat. We hurried together down the stairs and into the\r\nstreet. Dr. Mortimer and Baskerville were still visible about two\r\nhundred yards ahead of us in the direction of Oxford Street.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I run on and stop them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for the world, my dear Watson. I am perfectly satisfied with your\r\ncompany if you will tolerate mine. Our friends are wise, for it is\r\ncertainly a very fine morning for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided\r\nus by about half. Then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we\r\nfollowed into Oxford Street and so down Regent Street. Once our friends\r\nstopped and stared into a shop window, upon which Holmes did the\r\nsame. An instant afterwards he gave a little cry of satisfaction, and,\r\nfollowing the direction of his eager eyes, I saw that a hansom cab with\r\na man inside which had halted on the other side of the street was now\r\nproceeding slowly onward again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There's our man, Watson! Come along! We'll have a good look at him, if\r\nwe can do no more.\"\r\n\r\nAt that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\r\npiercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\r\nInstantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to\r\nthe driver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked\r\neagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed\r\nin wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too\r\ngreat, and already the cab was out of sight.\r\n\r\n\"There now!\" said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with\r\nvexation from the tide of vehicles. \"Was ever such bad luck and such\r\nbad management, too? Watson, Watson, if you are an honest man you will\r\nrecord this also and set it against my successes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the man?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not an idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"A spy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was evident from what we have heard that Baskerville has been\r\nvery closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. How else\r\ncould it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which\r\nhe had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they\r\nwould follow him also the second. You may have observed that I twice\r\nstrolled over to the window while Dr. Mortimer was reading his legend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was looking out for loiterers in the street, but I saw none. We\r\nare dealing with a clever man, Watson. This matter cuts very deep, and\r\nthough I have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or\r\na malevolent agency which is in touch with us, I am conscious always of\r\npower and design. When our friends left I at once followed them in the\r\nhopes of marking down their invisible attendant. So wily was he that he\r\nhad not trusted himself upon foot, but he had availed himself of a cab\r\nso that he could loiter behind or dash past them and so escape their\r\nnotice. His method had the additional advantage that if they were to\r\ntake a cab he was all ready to follow them. It has, however, one obvious\r\ndisadvantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"It puts him in the power of the cabman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity we did not get the number!\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Watson, clumsy as I have been, you surely do not seriously\r\nimagine that I neglected to get the number? No. 2704 is our man. But\r\nthat is no use to us for the moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fail to see how you could have done more.\"\r\n\r\n\"On observing the cab I should have instantly turned and walked in the\r\nother direction. I should then at my leisure have hired a second cab\r\nand followed the first at a respectful distance, or, better still, have\r\ndriven to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there. When our unknown\r\nhad followed Baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of\r\nplaying his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. As\r\nit is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with\r\nextraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed\r\nourselves and lost our man.\"\r\n\r\nWe had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\r\nconversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in\r\nfront of us.\r\n\r\n\"There is no object in our following them,\" said Holmes. \"The shadow has\r\ndeparted and will not return. We must see what further cards we have\r\nin our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man's\r\nface within the cab?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could swear only to the beard.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so could I--from which I gather that in all probability it was\r\na false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a\r\nbeard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was\r\nwarmly greeted by the manager.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I had\r\nthe good fortune to help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that\r\nyou had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability\r\nduring the investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, he is still with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could you ring him up?--thank you! And I should be glad to have change\r\nof this five-pound note.\"\r\n\r\nA lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons\r\nof the manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\n\"Let me have the Hotel Directory,\" said Holmes. \"Thank you! Now,\r\nCartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will visit each of these in turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.\r\nHere are twenty-three shillings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.\r\nYou will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are\r\nlooking for it. You understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times\r\nwith some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It\r\nis this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"In each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom\r\nalso you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will\r\nthen learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the\r\nwaste of the day before has been burned or removed. In the three other\r\ncases you will be shown a heap of paper and you will look for this page\r\nof the Times among it. The odds are enormously against your finding\r\nit. There are ten shillings over in case of emergencies. Let me have a\r\nreport by wire at Baker Street before evening. And now, Watson, it only\r\nremains for us to find out by wire the identity of the cabman, No. 2704,\r\nand then we will drop into one of the Bond Street picture galleries and\r\nfill in the time until we are due at the hotel.\"\r\n\nSherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching\r\nhis mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had\r\nbeen involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in\r\nthe pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing\r\nbut art, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery\r\nuntil we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you,\" said the clerk. \"He\r\nasked me to show you up at once when you came.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any objection to my looking at your register?\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least.\"\r\n\r\nThe book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.\r\nOne was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.\r\nOldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\r\n\r\n\"Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know,\" said Holmes\r\nto the porter. \"A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with a\r\nlimp?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,\r\nnot older than yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you are mistaken about his trade?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well\r\nknown to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.\r\nExcuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.\r\nShe always comes to us when she is in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\r\nestablished a most important fact by these questions, Watson,\" he\r\ncontinued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. \"We know now that\r\nthe people who are so interested in our friend have not settled down\r\nin his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen, very\r\nanxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not see\r\nthem. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it suggest?\"\r\n\r\n\"It suggests--halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?\"\r\n\r\nAs we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old\r\nand dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly\r\narticulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more\r\nWestern dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel,\" he cried.\r\n\"They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man unless\r\nthey are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing boot\r\nthere will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes, but\r\nthey've got a bit over the mark this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still looking for your boot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, and mean to find it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it was, sir. And now it's an old black one.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you don't mean to say--?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\r\nworld--the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I am\r\nwearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones, and today they have\r\nsneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man, and\r\ndon't stand staring!\"\r\n\r\nAn agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no word\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the\r\nmanager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be found, sir--I promise you that if you will have a little\r\npatience it will be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this den\r\nof thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my troubling you about\r\nsuch a trifle--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's well worth troubling about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you look very serious over it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you explain it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just don't attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest, queerest\r\nthing that ever happened to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"The queerest perhaps--\" said Holmes thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of it yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't profess to understand it yet. This case of yours is very\r\ncomplex, Sir Henry. When taken in conjunction with your uncle's death\r\nI am not sure that of all the five hundred cases of capital importance\r\nwhich I have handled there is one which cuts so deep. But we hold\r\nseveral threads in our hands, and the odds are that one or other of them\r\nguides us to the truth. We may waste time in following the wrong one,\r\nbut sooner or later we must come upon the right.\"\r\n\r\nWe had a pleasant luncheon in which little was said of the business\r\nwhich had brought us together. It was in the private sitting-room to\r\nwhich we afterwards repaired that Holmes asked Baskerville what were his\r\nintentions.\r\n\r\n\"To go to Baskerville Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the end of the week.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the whole,\" said Holmes, \"I think that your decision is a wise one.\r\nI have ample evidence that you are being dogged in London, and amid the\r\nmillions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people\r\nare or what their object can be. If their intentions are evil they might\r\ndo you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. You did not\r\nknow, Dr. Mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer started violently. \"Followed! By whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your\r\nneighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full\r\nbeard?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--or, let me see--why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a man\r\nwith a full, black beard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Where is Barrymore?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in charge of the Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility\r\nhe might be in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me a telegraph form. 'Is all ready for Sir Henry?' That will\r\ndo. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest\r\ntelegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the\r\npostmaster, Grimpen: 'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into\r\nhis own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,\r\nNorthumberland Hotel.' That should let us know before evening whether\r\nBarrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Baskerville. \"By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is this\r\nBarrymore, anyhow?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked after\r\nthe Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he and his wife are\r\nas respectable a couple as any in the county.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the same time,\" said Baskerville, \"it's clear enough that so long as\r\nthere are none of the family at the Hall these people have a mighty fine\r\nhome and nothing to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did Barrymore profit at all by Sir Charles's will?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"He and his wife had five hundred pounds each.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Did they know that they would receive this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; Sir Charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very interesting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Dr. Mortimer, \"that you do not look with suspicious eyes\r\nupon everyone who received a legacy from Sir Charles, for I also had a\r\nthousand pounds left to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! And anyone else?\"\r\n\r\n\"There were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number\r\nof public charities. The residue all went to Sir Henry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how much was the residue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seven hundred and forty thousand pounds.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. \"I had no idea that so gigantic\r\na sum was involved,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Sir Charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how\r\nvery rich he was until we came to examine his securities. The total\r\nvalue of the estate was close on to a million.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! It is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate\r\ngame. And one more question, Dr. Mortimer. Supposing that anything\r\nhappened to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant\r\nhypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died unmarried,\r\nthe estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant cousins. James\r\nDesmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.\r\nJames Desmond?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable\r\nappearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any\r\nsettlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's\r\nthousands.\"\r\n\r\n\"He would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would\r\nalso be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the\r\npresent owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have you made your will, Sir Henry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only yesterday\r\nthat I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that the money\r\nshould go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle's idea. How\r\nis the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles if he has\r\nnot money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and dollars must\r\ngo together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\r\nadvisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay. There is\r\nonly one provision which I must make. You certainly must not go alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Mortimer returns with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Dr. Mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles\r\naway from yours. With all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to\r\nhelp you. No, Sir Henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man,\r\nwho will be always by your side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that you could come yourself, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"If matters came to a crisis I should endeavour to be present in person;\r\nbut you can understand that, with my extensive consulting practice\r\nand with the constant appeals which reach me from many quarters, it is\r\nimpossible for me to be absent from London for an indefinite time. At\r\nthe present instant one of the most revered names in England is being\r\nbesmirched by a blackmailer, and only I can stop a disastrous scandal.\r\nYou will see how impossible it is for me to go to Dartmoor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whom would you recommend, then?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laid his hand upon my arm. \"If my friend would undertake it there\r\nis no man who is better worth having at your side when you are in a\r\ntight place. No one can say so more confidently than I.\"\r\n\r\nThe proposition took me completely by surprise, but before I had time to\r\nanswer, Baskerville seized me by the hand and wrung it heartily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, that is real kind of you, Dr. Watson,\" said he. \"You see how\r\nit is with me, and you know just as much about the matter as I do. If\r\nyou will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me through I'll never\r\nforget it.\"\r\n\r\nThe promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was\r\ncomplimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the\r\nbaronet hailed me as a companion.\r\n\r\n\"I will come, with pleasure,\" said I. \"I do not know how I could employ\r\nmy time better.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will report very carefully to me,\" said Holmes. \"When a crisis\r\ncomes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose that by\r\nSaturday all might be ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would that suit Dr. Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the\r\nten-thirty train from Paddington.\"\r\n\r\nWe had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and\r\ndiving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from\r\nunder a cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"My missing boot!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"May all our difficulties vanish as easily!\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"But it is a very singular thing,\" Dr. Mortimer remarked. \"I searched\r\nthis room carefully before lunch.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so did I,\" said Baskerville. \"Every inch of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was certainly no boot in it then.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\r\nlunching.\"\r\n\r\nThe German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter,\r\nnor could any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that\r\nconstant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had\r\nsucceeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of\r\nSir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within\r\nthe limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed\r\nletter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown\r\nboot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\r\nbrown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker\r\nStreet, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind,\r\nlike my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which\r\nall these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.\r\nAll afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nJust before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran:\r\n\r\nHave just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. BASKERVILLE.\r\n\r\nThe second:\r\n\r\nVisited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable to\r\ntrace cut sheet of Times. CARTWRIGHT.\r\n\r\n\"There go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating\r\nthan a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for\r\nanother scent.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have still the cabman who drove the spy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official\r\nRegistry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nThe ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory\r\nthan an answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow\r\nentered who was evidently the man himself.\r\n\r\n\"I got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had\r\nbeen inquiring for No. 2704,\" said he. \"I've driven my cab this seven\r\nyears and never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard\r\nto ask you to your face what you had against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing in the world against you, my good man,\" said Holmes.\r\n\"On the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a\r\nclear answer to my questions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I've had a good day and no mistake,\" said the cabman with a grin.\r\n\"What was it you wanted to ask, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"First of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"John Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of Shipley's\r\nYard, near Waterloo Station.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes made a note of it.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this\r\nhouse at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two\r\ngentlemen down Regent Street.\"\r\n\r\nThe man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. \"Why, there's no good\r\nmy telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do already,\"\r\nsaid he. \"The truth is that the gentleman told me that he was a\r\ndetective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good fellow; this is a very serious business, and you may find\r\nyourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything from me.\r\nYou say that your fare told you that he was a detective?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"When did he say this?\"\r\n\r\n\"When he left me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say anything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"He mentioned his name.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes cast a swift glance of triumph at me. \"Oh, he mentioned his name,\r\ndid he? That was imprudent. What was the name that he mentioned?\"\r\n\r\n\"His name,\" said the cabman, \"was Mr. Sherlock Holmes.\"\r\n\r\nNever have I seen my friend more completely taken aback than by the\r\ncabman's reply. For an instant he sat in silent amazement. Then he burst\r\ninto a hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n\"A touch, Watson--an undeniable touch!\" said he. \"I feel a foil as quick\r\nand supple as my own. He got home upon me very prettily that time. So\r\nhis name was Sherlock Holmes, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that was the gentleman's name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! Tell me where you picked him up and all that occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"He hailed me at half-past nine in Trafalgar Square. He said that he was\r\na detective, and he offered me two guineas if I would do exactly what he\r\nwanted all day and ask no questions. I was glad enough to agree. First\r\nwe drove down to the Northumberland Hotel and waited there until two\r\ngentlemen came out and took a cab from the rank. We followed their cab\r\nuntil it pulled up somewhere near here.\"\r\n\r\n\"This very door,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all about\r\nit. We pulled up halfway down the street and waited an hour and a half.\r\nThen the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down Baker\r\nStreet and along--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Until we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman threw\r\nup the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to Waterloo\r\nStation as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we were there\r\nunder the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like a good one,\r\nand away he went into the station. Only just as he was leaving he turned\r\nround and he said: 'It might interest you to know that you have been\r\ndriving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to know the name.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. And you saw no more of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not after he went into the station.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how would you describe Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\r\n\r\nThe cabman scratched his head. \"Well, he wasn't altogether such an easy\r\ngentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of age, and he was\r\nof a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He was\r\ndressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the end,\r\nand a pale face. I don't know as I could say more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Colour of his eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I can't say that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more that you can remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, here is your half-sovereign. There's another one waiting\r\nfor you if you can bring any more information. Good-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, sir, and thank you!\"\r\n\r\nJohn Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of\r\nhis shoulders and a rueful smile.\r\n\r\n\"Snap goes our third thread, and we end where we began,\" said he. \"The\r\ncunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry Baskerville had\r\nconsulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street, conjectured that I had\r\ngot the number of the cab and would lay my hands on the driver, and so\r\nsent back this audacious message. I tell you, Watson, this time we have\r\ngot a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I've been checkmated in London.\r\nI can only wish you better luck in Devonshire. But I'm not easy in my\r\nmind about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"About sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous\r\nbusiness, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear\r\nfellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad\r\nto have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.\"\r\n\nSir Henry Baskerville and Dr. Mortimer were ready upon the appointed\r\nday, and we started as arranged for Devonshire. Mr. Sherlock Holmes\r\ndrove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions\r\nand advice.\r\n\r\n\"I will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,\r\nWatson,\" said he; \"I wish you simply to report facts in the fullest\r\npossible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of facts?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Anything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the\r\ncase, and especially the relations between young Baskerville and his\r\nneighbours or any fresh particulars concerning the death of Sir Charles.\r\nI have made some inquiries myself in the last few days, but the results\r\nhave, I fear, been negative. One thing only appears to be certain, and\r\nthat is that Mr. James Desmond, who is the next heir, is an elderly\r\ngentleman of a very amiable disposition, so that this persecution does\r\nnot arise from him. I really think that we may eliminate him entirely\r\nfrom our calculations. There remain the people who will actually\r\nsurround Sir Henry Baskerville upon the moor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would it not be well in the first place to get rid of this Barrymore\r\ncouple?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means. You could not make a greater mistake. If they are innocent\r\nit would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be\r\ngiving up all chance of bringing it home to them. No, no, we will\r\npreserve them upon our list of suspects. Then there is a groom at the\r\nHall, if I remember right. There are two moorland farmers. There is our\r\nfriend Dr. Mortimer, whom I believe to be entirely honest, and there is\r\nhis wife, of whom we know nothing. There is this naturalist, Stapleton,\r\nand there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.\r\nThere is Mr. Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who is also an unknown factor,\r\nand there are one or two other neighbours. These are the folk who must\r\nbe your very special study.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have arms, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I thought it as well to take them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly. Keep your revolver near you night and day, and never\r\nrelax your precautions.\"\r\n\r\nOur friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting\r\nfor us upon the platform.\r\n\r\n\"No, we have no news of any kind,\" said Dr. Mortimer in answer to my\r\nfriend's questions. \"I can swear to one thing, and that is that we\r\nhave not been shadowed during the last two days. We have never gone\r\nout without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have always kept together, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except yesterday afternoon. I usually give up one day to pure amusement\r\nwhen I come to town, so I spent it at the Museum of the College of\r\nSurgeons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I went to look at the folk in the park,\" said Baskerville.\r\n\r\n\"But we had no trouble of any kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was imprudent, all the same,\" said Holmes, shaking his head and\r\nlooking very grave. \"I beg, Sir Henry, that you will not go about alone.\r\nSome great misfortune will befall you if you do. Did you get your other\r\nboot?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, it is gone forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed. That is very interesting. Well, good-bye,\" he added as the\r\ntrain began to glide down the platform. \"Bear in mind, Sir Henry, one of\r\nthe phrases in that queer old legend which Dr. Mortimer has read to us,\r\nand avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil\r\nare exalted.\"\r\n\r\nI looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the\r\ntall, austere figure of Holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.\r\n\r\nThe journey was a swift and pleasant one, and I spent it in making the\r\nmore intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with\r\nDr. Mortimer's spaniel. In a very few hours the brown earth had\r\nbecome ruddy, the brick had changed to granite, and red cows grazed in\r\nwell-hedged fields where the lush grasses and more luxuriant vegetation\r\nspoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. Young Baskerville stared\r\neagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized\r\nthe familiar features of the Devon scenery.\r\n\r\n\"I've been over a good part of the world since I left it, Dr. Watson,\"\r\nsaid he; \"but I have never seen a place to compare with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never saw a Devonshire man who did not swear by his county,\" I\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n\"It depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,\" said\r\nDr. Mortimer. \"A glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of\r\nthe Celt, which carries inside it the Celtic enthusiasm and power\r\nof attachment. Poor Sir Charles's head was of a very rare type, half\r\nGaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. But you were very young\r\nwhen you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was a boy in my teens at the time of my father's death and had never\r\nseen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South Coast.\r\nThence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is all as\r\nnew to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to see the\r\nmoor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first\r\nsight of the moor,\" said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nOver the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there\r\nrose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged\r\nsummit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in\r\na dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I\r\nread upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of\r\nthat strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long\r\nand left their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his\r\nAmerican accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as\r\nI looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how\r\ntrue a descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery,\r\nand masterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick\r\nbrows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that\r\nforbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,\r\nthis was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk\r\nwith the certainty that he would bravely share it.\r\n\r\nThe train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.\r\nOutside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs\r\nwas waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master\r\nand porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,\r\nsimple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate\r\nthere stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms who leaned upon their\r\nshort rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a\r\nhard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in\r\na few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling\r\npasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses\r\npeeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful\r\nand sunlit countryside there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,\r\nthe long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through\r\ndeep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy\r\nwith dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns. Bronzing bracken and\r\nmottled bramble gleamed in the light of the sinking sun. Still steadily\r\nrising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge and skirted a noisy\r\nstream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray\r\nboulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with\r\nscrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\r\ndelight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To\r\nhis eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon\r\nthe countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.\r\nYellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we\r\npassed. The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of\r\nrotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw\r\nbefore the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa!\" cried Dr. Mortimer, \"what is this?\"\r\n\r\nA steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in\r\nfront of us. On the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue\r\nupon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle\r\npoised ready over his forearm. He was watching the road along which we\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\n\"What is this, Perkins?\" asked Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\nOur driver half turned in his seat. \"There's a convict escaped from\r\nPrincetown, sir. He's been out three days now, and the warders watch\r\nevery road and every station, but they've had no sight of him yet. The\r\nfarmers about here don't like it, sir, and that's a fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I understand that they get five pounds if they can give\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared\r\nto the chance of having your throat cut. You see, it isn't like any\r\nordinary convict. This is a man that would stick at nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is he, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Selden, the Notting Hill murderer.\"\r\n\r\nI remembered the case well, for it was one in which Holmes had taken an\r\ninterest on account of the peculiar ferocity of the crime and the\r\nwanton brutality which had marked all the actions of the assassin. The\r\ncommutation of his death sentence had been due to some doubts as to his\r\ncomplete sanity, so atrocious was his conduct. Our wagonette had topped\r\na rise and in front of us rose the huge expanse of the moor, mottled\r\nwith gnarled and craggy cairns and tors. A cold wind swept down from\r\nit and set us shivering. Somewhere there, on that desolate plain, was\r\nlurking this fiendish man, hiding in a burrow like a wild beast, his\r\nheart full of malignancy against the whole race which had cast him out.\r\nIt needed but this to complete the grim suggestiveness of the barren\r\nwaste, the chilling wind, and the darkling sky. Even Baskerville fell\r\nsilent and pulled his overcoat more closely around him.\r\n\r\nWe had left the fertile country behind and beneath us. We looked back on\r\nit now, the slanting rays of a low sun turning the streams to threads of\r\ngold and glowing on the red earth new turned by the plough and the broad\r\ntangle of the woodlands. The road in front of us grew bleaker and wilder\r\nover huge russet and olive slopes, sprinkled with giant boulders. Now\r\nand then we passed a moorland cottage, walled and roofed with stone,\r\nwith no creeper to break its harsh outline. Suddenly we looked down into\r\na cuplike depression, patched with stunted oaks and firs which had been\r\ntwisted and bent by the fury of years of storm. Two high, narrow towers\r\nrose over the trees. The driver pointed with his whip.\r\n\r\n\"Baskerville Hall,\" said he.\r\n\r\nIts master had risen and was staring with flushed cheeks and shining\r\neyes. A few minutes later we had reached the lodge-gates, a maze of\r\nfantastic tracery in wrought iron, with weather-bitten pillars on either\r\nside, blotched with lichens, and surmounted by the boars' heads of the\r\nBaskervilles. The lodge was a ruin of black granite and bared ribs of\r\nrafters, but facing it was a new building, half constructed, the first\r\nfruit of Sir Charles's South African gold.\r\n\r\nThrough the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were\r\nagain hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a\r\nsombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up\r\nthe long, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the\r\nfarther end.\r\n\r\n\"Was it here?\" he asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, the yew alley is on the other side.\"\r\n\r\nThe young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\r\n\r\n\"It's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such a\r\nplace as this,\" said he. \"It's enough to scare any man. I'll have a row\r\nof electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won't know it\r\nagain, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here in front\r\nof the hall door.\"\r\n\r\nThe avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before\r\nus. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block\r\nof building from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in\r\nivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a coat\r\nof arms broke through the dark veil. From this central block rose the\r\ntwin towers, ancient, crenelated, and pierced with many loopholes. To\r\nright and left of the turrets were more modern wings of black granite.\r\nA dull light shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high\r\nchimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a\r\nsingle black column of smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\"\r\n\r\nA tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of\r\nthe wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow\r\nlight of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our\r\nbags.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry?\" said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\"My wife is expecting me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely you will stay and have some dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would\r\nstay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide\r\nthan I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I\r\ncan be of service.\"\r\n\r\nThe wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned\r\ninto the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine\r\napartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily\r\nraftered with huge baulks of age-blackened oak. In the great\r\nold-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled\r\nand snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb\r\nfrom our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window\r\nof old stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the coats\r\nof arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of the\r\ncentral lamp.\r\n\r\n\"It's just as I imagined it,\" said Sir Henry. \"Is it not the very\r\npicture of an old family home? To think that this should be the same\r\nhall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me\r\nsolemn to think of it.\"\r\n\r\nI saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about\r\nhim. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed\r\ndown the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had\r\nreturned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of\r\nus now with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a\r\nremarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and\r\npale, distinguished features.\r\n\r\n\"Would you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My\r\nwife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have\r\nmade your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new\r\nconditions this house will require a considerable staff.\"\r\n\r\n\"What new conditions?\"\r\n\r\n\"I only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we\r\nwere able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have\r\nmore company, and so you will need changes in your household.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your family have been with us for several generations, have they\r\nnot? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family\r\nconnection.\"\r\n\r\nI seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.\r\n\r\n\"I feel that also, sir, and so does my wife. But to tell the truth, sir,\r\nwe were both very much attached to Sir Charles, and his death gave us\r\na shock and made these surroundings very painful to us. I fear that we\r\nshall never again be easy in our minds at Baskerville Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt, sir, that we shall succeed in establishing ourselves\r\nin some business. Sir Charles's generosity has given us the means to do\r\nso. And now, sir, perhaps I had best show you to your rooms.\"\r\n\r\nA square balustraded gallery ran round the top of the old hall,\r\napproached by a double stair. From this central point two long corridors\r\nextended the whole length of the building, from which all the bedrooms\r\nopened. My own was in the same wing as Baskerville's and almost next\r\ndoor to it. These rooms appeared to be much more modern than the\r\ncentral part of the house, and the bright paper and numerous candles\r\ndid something to remove the sombre impression which our arrival had left\r\nupon my mind.\r\n\r\nBut the dining-room which opened out of the hall was a place of shadow\r\nand gloom. It was a long chamber with a step separating the dais where\r\nthe family sat from the lower portion reserved for their dependents.\r\nAt one end a minstrel's gallery overlooked it. Black beams shot across\r\nabove our heads, with a smoke-darkened ceiling beyond them. With rows of\r\nflaring torches to light it up, and the colour and rude hilarity of\r\nan old-time banquet, it might have softened; but now, when two\r\nblack-clothed gentlemen sat in the little circle of light thrown by a\r\nshaded lamp, one's voice became hushed and one's spirit subdued. A\r\ndim line of ancestors, in every variety of dress, from the Elizabethan\r\nknight to the buck of the Regency, stared down upon us and daunted us by\r\ntheir silent company. We talked little, and I for one was glad when the\r\nmeal was over and we were able to retire into the modern billiard-room\r\nand smoke a cigarette.\r\n\r\n\"My word, it isn't a very cheerful place,\" said Sir Henry. \"I suppose\r\none can tone down to it, but I feel a bit out of the picture at present.\r\nI don't wonder that my uncle got a little jumpy if he lived all alone\r\nin such a house as this. However, if it suits you, we will retire early\r\ntonight, and perhaps things may seem more cheerful in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nI drew aside my curtains before I went to bed and looked out from my\r\nwindow. It opened upon the grassy space which lay in front of the hall\r\ndoor. Beyond, two copses of trees moaned and swung in a rising wind. A\r\nhalf moon broke through the rifts of racing clouds. In its cold light I\r\nsaw beyond the trees a broken fringe of rocks, and the long, low curve\r\nof the melancholy moor. I closed the curtain, feeling that my last\r\nimpression was in keeping with the rest.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not quite the last. I found myself weary and yet wakeful,\r\ntossing restlessly from side to side, seeking for the sleep which would\r\nnot come. Far away a chiming clock struck out the quarters of the\r\nhours, but otherwise a deathly silence lay upon the old house. And then\r\nsuddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my\r\nears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. It was the sob of a woman, the\r\nmuffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow.\r\nI sat up in bed and listened intently. The noise could not have been\r\nfar away and was certainly in the house. For half an hour I waited with\r\nevery nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming\r\nclock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.\r\n\nThe fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from\r\nour minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of\r\nus by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat\r\nat breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,\r\nthrowing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered\r\nthem. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it\r\nwas hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck\r\nsuch a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!\" said\r\nthe baronet. \"We were tired with our journey and chilled by our drive,\r\nso we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well, so it is\r\nall cheerful once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it was not entirely a question of imagination,\" I answered.\r\n\"Did you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing\r\nin the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard\r\nsomething of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of\r\nit, so I concluded that it was all a dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must ask about this right away.\" He rang the bell and asked\r\nBarrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me\r\nthat the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he\r\nlistened to his master's question.\r\n\r\n\"There are only two women in the house, Sir Henry,\" he answered. \"One is\r\nthe scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my wife,\r\nand I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met\r\nMrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She\r\nwas a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression\r\nof mouth. But her telltale eyes were red and glanced at me from between\r\nswollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so\r\nher husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery\r\nin declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she\r\nweep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded\r\nman there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he\r\nwho had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had\r\nonly his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's\r\ndeath. Was it possible that it was Barrymore, after all, whom we had\r\nseen in the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the\r\nsame. The cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an\r\nimpression might easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the\r\npoint forever? Obviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen\r\npostmaster and find whether the test telegram had really been placed in\r\nBarrymore's own hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least\r\nhave something to report to Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nSir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the\r\ntime was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four\r\nmiles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray\r\nhamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and\r\nthe house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,\r\nwho was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir,\" said he, \"I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\r\nBarrymore exactly as directed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who delivered it?\"\r\n\r\n\"My boy here. James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at the\r\nHall last week, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father, I delivered it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Into his own hands?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it\r\ninto his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she\r\npromised to deliver it at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see Mr. Barrymore?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, surely his own wife ought to know where he is,\" said the\r\npostmaster testily. \"Didn't he get the telegram? If there is any mistake\r\nit is for Mr. Barrymore himself to complain.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed hopeless to pursue the inquiry any farther, but it was clear\r\nthat in spite of Holmes's ruse we had no proof that Barrymore had not\r\nbeen in London all the time. Suppose that it were so--suppose that the\r\nsame man had been the last who had seen Sir Charles alive, and the first\r\nto dog the new heir when he returned to England. What then? Was he the\r\nagent of others or had he some sinister design of his own? What interest\r\ncould he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the\r\nstrange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times. Was\r\nthat his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon\r\ncounteracting his schemes? The only conceivable motive was that which\r\nhad been suggested by Sir Henry, that if the family could be scared away\r\na comfortable and permanent home would be secured for the Barrymores.\r\nBut surely such an explanation as that would be quite inadequate to\r\naccount for the deep and subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an\r\ninvisible net round the young baronet. Holmes himself had said that\r\nno more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his\r\nsensational investigations. I prayed, as I walked back along the gray,\r\nlonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations\r\nand able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from\r\nmy shoulders.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet\r\nbehind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to\r\nsee Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing\r\nme. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired\r\nand leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray\r\nsuit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung\r\nover his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n\"You will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson,\" said he as he\r\ncame panting up to where I stood. \"Here on the moor we are homely folk\r\nand do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have heard\r\nmy name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of Merripit\r\nHouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your net and box would have told me as much,\" said I, \"for I knew that\r\nMr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from\r\nthe window of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I\r\nthought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir\r\nHenry is none the worse for his journey?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is very well, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the\r\nnew baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy\r\nman to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need\r\nnot tell you that it means a very great deal to the countryside. Sir\r\nHenry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think that it is likely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\r\nfamily?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any\r\nnumber of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature\r\nupon the moor.\" He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes\r\nthat he took the matter more seriously. \"The story took a great hold\r\nupon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to\r\nhis tragic end.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"His nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have\r\nhad a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really\r\ndid see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. I\r\nfeared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old\r\nman, and I knew that his heart was weak.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you know that?\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend Mortimer told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died of\r\nfright in consequence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you any better explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not come to any conclusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\r\n\r\nThe words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid\r\nface and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was\r\nintended.\r\n\r\n\"It is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,\"\r\nsaid he. \"The records of your detective have reached us here, and you\r\ncould not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told\r\nme your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it\r\nfollows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter,\r\nand I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid that I cannot answer that question.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"He cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.\r\nBut as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I\r\ncan be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had\r\nany indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to\r\ninvestigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or\r\nadvice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir\r\nHenry, and that I need no help of any kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" said Stapleton. \"You are perfectly right to be wary and\r\ndiscreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable\r\nintrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.\"\r\n\r\nWe had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the\r\nroad and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay\r\nupon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.\r\nThe face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and\r\nbrambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a\r\ngray plume of smoke.\r\n\r\n\"A moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,\"\r\nsaid he. \"Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure of\r\nintroducing you to my sister.\"\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But then I\r\nremembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was\r\nlittered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes\r\nhad expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I\r\naccepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.\r\n\r\n\"It is a wonderful place, the moor,\" said he, looking round over the\r\nundulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite\r\nfoaming up into fantastic surges. \"You never tire of the moor. You\r\ncannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and\r\nso barren, and so mysterious.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know it well, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only been here two years. The residents would call me a\r\nnewcomer. We came shortly after Sir Charles settled. But my tastes led\r\nme to explore every part of the country round, and I should think that\r\nthere are few men who know it better than I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it hard to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very hard. You see, for example, this great plain to the north here\r\nwith the queer hills breaking out of it. Do you observe anything\r\nremarkable about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a rare place for a gallop.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would naturally think so and the thought has cost several their\r\nlives before now. You notice those bright green spots scattered thickly\r\nover it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they seem more fertile than the rest.\"\r\n\r\nStapleton laughed. \"That is the great Grimpen Mire,\" said he. \"A false\r\nstep yonder means death to man or beast. Only yesterday I saw one of the\r\nmoor ponies wander into it. He never came out. I saw his head for quite\r\na long time craning out of the bog-hole, but it sucked him down at last.\r\nEven in dry seasons it is a danger to cross it, but after these autumn\r\nrains it is an awful place. And yet I can find my way to the very heart\r\nof it and return alive. By George, there is another of those miserable\r\nponies!\"\r\n\r\nSomething brown was rolling and tossing among the green sedges. Then a\r\nlong, agonized, writhing neck shot upward and a dreadful cry echoed\r\nover the moor. It turned me cold with horror, but my companion's nerves\r\nseemed to be stronger than mine.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone!\" said he. \"The mire has him. Two in two days, and many more,\r\nperhaps, for they get in the way of going there in the dry weather and\r\nnever know the difference until the mire has them in its clutches. It's\r\na bad place, the great Grimpen Mire.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you say you can penetrate it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are one or two paths which a very active man can take. I\r\nhave found them out.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should you wish to go into so horrible a place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see the hills beyond? They are really islands cut off on all\r\nsides by the impassable mire, which has crawled round them in the course\r\nof years. That is where the rare plants and the butterflies are, if you\r\nhave the wit to reach them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall try my luck some day.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at me with a surprised face. \"For God's sake put such an idea\r\nout of your mind,\" said he. \"Your blood would be upon my head. I assure\r\nyou that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.\r\nIt is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that I am able to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Halloa!\" I cried. \"What is that?\"\r\n\r\nA long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. It filled the\r\nwhole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. From a\r\ndull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a\r\nmelancholy, throbbing murmur once again. Stapleton looked at me with a\r\ncurious expression in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Queer place, the moor!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its\r\nprey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.\"\r\n\r\nI looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling\r\nplain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over\r\nthe vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n\"You are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense as that?\" said\r\nI. \"What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or the water\r\nrising, or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, that was a living voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never did.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a very rare bird--practically extinct--in England now, but all\r\nthings are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to\r\nlearn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it's rather an uncanny place altogether. Look at the hillside\r\nyonder. What do you make of those?\"\r\n\r\nThe whole steep slope was covered with gray circular rings of stone, a\r\nscore of them at least.\r\n\r\n\"What are they? Sheep-pens?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they are the homes of our worthy ancestors. Prehistoric man lived\r\nthickly on the moor, and as no one in particular has lived there since,\r\nwe find all his little arrangements exactly as he left them. These are\r\nhis wigwams with the roofs off. You can even see his hearth and his\r\ncouch if you have the curiosity to go inside.\r\n\r\n\"But it is quite a town. When was it inhabited?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neolithic man--no date.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did he do?\"\r\n\r\n\"He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin\r\nwhen the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the\r\ngreat trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will find\r\nsome very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse me an\r\ninstant! It is surely Cyclopides.\"\r\n\r\nA small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant\r\nStapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit of\r\nit. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire, and my\r\nacquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft to tuft\r\nbehind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes and jerky,\r\nzigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge moth himself.\r\nI was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his\r\nextraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the\r\ntreacherous mire, when I heard the sound of steps and, turning round,\r\nfound a woman near me upon the path. She had come from the direction in\r\nwhich the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but\r\nthe dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.\r\n\r\nI could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had\r\nbeen told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I\r\nremembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The\r\nwoman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.\r\nThere could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,\r\nfor Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while\r\nshe was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England--slim,\r\nelegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut face, so regular that it\r\nmight have seemed impassive were it not for the sensitive mouth and the\r\nbeautiful dark, eager eyes. With her perfect figure and elegant dress\r\nshe was, indeed, a strange apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her\r\neyes were on her brother as I turned, and then she quickened her pace\r\ntowards me. I had raised my hat and was about to make some explanatory\r\nremark when her own words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.\r\n\r\n\"Go back!\" she said. \"Go straight back to London, instantly.\"\r\n\r\nI could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me, and\r\nshe tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I go back?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot explain.\" She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious lisp\r\nin her utterance. \"But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back and\r\nnever set foot upon the moor again.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I have only just come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Man, man!\" she cried. \"Can you not tell when a warning is for your own\r\ngood? Go back to London! Start tonight! Get away from this place at all\r\ncosts! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have said. Would\r\nyou mind getting that orchid for me among the mare's-tails yonder? We\r\nare very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course, you are rather\r\nlate to see the beauties of the place.\"\r\n\r\nStapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard and\r\nflushed with his exertions.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa, Beryl!\" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his\r\ngreeting was not altogether a cordial one.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Jack, you are very hot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in\r\nthe late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!\" He spoke\r\nunconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the\r\ngirl to me.\r\n\r\n\"You have introduced yourselves, I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see the\r\ntrue beauties of the moor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, who do you think this is?\"\r\n\r\n\"I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said I. \"Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is\r\nDr. Watson.\"\r\n\r\nA flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. \"We have been\r\ntalking at cross purposes,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you had not very much time for talk,\" her brother remarked with\r\nthe same questioning eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a\r\nvisitor,\" said she. \"It cannot much matter to him whether it is early\r\nor late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see\r\nMerripit House?\"\r\n\r\nA short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm\r\nof some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and\r\nturned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,\r\nas is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of\r\nthe whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,\r\nwizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with\r\nthe house. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an\r\nelegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I\r\nlooked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\r\nrolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what\r\ncould have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to\r\nlive in such a place.\r\n\r\n\"Queer spot to choose, is it not?\" said he as if in answer to my\r\nthought. \"And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,\r\nBeryl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite happy,\" said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"I had a school,\" said Stapleton. \"It was in the north country. The work\r\nto a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the\r\nprivilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds,\r\nand of impressing them with one's own character and ideals was very dear\r\nto me. However, the fates were against us. A serious epidemic broke out\r\nin the school and three of the boys died. It never recovered from the\r\nblow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. And yet,\r\nif it were not for the loss of the charming companionship of the boys,\r\nI could rejoice over my own misfortune, for, with my strong tastes\r\nfor botany and zoology, I find an unlimited field of work here, and my\r\nsister is as devoted to Nature as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been\r\nbrought upon your head by your expression as you surveyed the moor out\r\nof our window.\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less for\r\nyou, perhaps, than for your sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I am never dull,\" said she quickly.\r\n\r\n\"We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting neighbours.\r\nDr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor Sir Charles was\r\nalso an admirable companion. We knew him well and miss him more than\r\nI can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if I were to call this\r\nafternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir Henry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that he would be delighted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in\r\nour humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he\r\nbecomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs, Dr.\r\nWatson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is the most\r\ncomplete one in the south-west of England. By the time that you have\r\nlooked through them lunch will be almost ready.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,\r\nthe death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been\r\nassociated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things\r\ntinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less\r\nvague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of\r\nMiss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could\r\nnot doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted\r\nall pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return\r\njourney, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those\r\nwho knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see\r\nMiss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face\r\nwas beautifully flushed with her exertions and she held her hand to her\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson,\" said she.\r\n\"I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my brother\r\nmay miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the stupid\r\nmistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget the\r\nwords I said, which have no application whatever to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton,\" said I. \"I am Sir Henry's\r\nfriend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why it\r\nwas that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to London.\"\r\n\r\n\"A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will understand\r\nthat I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in\r\nyour eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever\r\nsince I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.\r\nLife has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green patches\r\neverywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point the track.\r\nTell me then what it was that you meant, and I will promise to convey\r\nyour warning to Sir Henry.\"\r\n\r\nAn expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face, but\r\nher eyes had hardened again when she answered me.\r\n\r\n\"You make too much of it, Dr. Watson,\" said she. \"My brother and I\r\nwere very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very\r\nintimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He\r\nwas deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and when\r\nthis tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some grounds\r\nfor the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed therefore when\r\nanother member of the family came down to live here, and I felt that he\r\nshould be warned of the danger which he will run. That was all which I\r\nintended to convey.\r\n\r\n\"But what is the danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know the story of the hound?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe in such nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away from\r\na place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is wide.\r\nWhy should he wish to live at the place of danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I fear\r\nthat unless you can give me some more definite information than this it\r\nwould be impossible to get him to move.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no\r\nmore than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your\r\nbrother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or\r\nanyone else, could object.\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks it\r\nis for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very angry\r\nif he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry to\r\ngo away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must go\r\nback, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you. Good-bye!\"\r\nShe turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the scattered\r\nboulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued my way to\r\nBaskerville Hall.\r\n\nFrom this point onward I will follow the course of events by\r\ntranscribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me\r\non the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly\r\nas written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more\r\naccurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can\r\npossibly do.\r\n\r\n\r\nBaskerville Hall, October 13th. MY DEAR HOLMES: My previous letters\r\nand telegrams have kept you pretty well up to date as to all that has\r\noccurred in this most God-forsaken corner of the world. The longer one\r\nstays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul,\r\nits vastness, and also its grim charm. When you are once out upon its\r\nbosom you have left all traces of modern England behind you, but, on the\r\nother hand, you are conscious everywhere of the homes and the work of\r\nthe prehistoric people. On all sides of you as you walk are the houses\r\nof these forgotten folk, with their graves and the huge monoliths which\r\nare supposed to have marked their temples. As you look at their gray\r\nstone huts against the scarred hillsides you leave your own age behind\r\nyou, and if you were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the\r\nlow door fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you\r\nwould feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The\r\nstrange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must\r\nalways have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could\r\nimagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were forced\r\nto accept that which none other would occupy.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and\r\nwill probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.\r\nI can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun\r\nmoved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,\r\nreturn to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.\r\n\r\nIf you have not had any report within the last few days it is because\r\nup to today there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very\r\nsurprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course.\r\nBut, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other\r\nfactors in the situation.\r\n\r\nOne of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\r\nconvict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he\r\nhas got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely\r\nhouseholders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,\r\nduring which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It\r\nis surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during\r\nall that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is\r\nno difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a\r\nhiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and\r\nslaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,\r\nand the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\r\n\r\nWe are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take\r\ngood care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments\r\nwhen I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.\r\nThere are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the\r\nlatter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a\r\ndesperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal if he could once effect\r\nan entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their situation, and\r\nit was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to sleep there,\r\nbut Stapleton would not hear of it.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a\r\nconsiderable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered\r\nat, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like\r\nhim, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is\r\nsomething tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular contrast\r\nto her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the idea of\r\nhidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over her, for\r\nI have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as if seeking\r\napprobation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to her. There is\r\na dry glitter in his eyes and a firm set of his thin lips, which goes\r\nwith a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You would find him an\r\ninteresting study.\r\n\r\nHe came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very\r\nnext morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of the\r\nwicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an excursion of\r\nsome miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might\r\nhave suggested the story. We found a short valley between rugged tors\r\nwhich led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton\r\ngrass. In the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at\r\nthe upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some\r\nmonstrous beast. In every way it corresponded with the scene of the old\r\ntragedy. Sir Henry was much interested and asked Stapleton more\r\nthan once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the\r\ninterference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. He spoke\r\nlightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. Stapleton\r\nwas guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less\r\nthan he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of\r\nconsideration for the feelings of the baronet. He told us of similar\r\ncases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left\r\nus with the impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.\r\n\r\nOn our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was there\r\nthat Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From the first\r\nmoment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and\r\nI am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He referred to her\r\nagain and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed\r\nthat we have not seen something of the brother and sister. They dine\r\nhere tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. One\r\nwould imagine that such a match would be very welcome to Stapleton, and\r\nyet I have more than once caught a look of the strongest disapprobation\r\nin his face when Sir Henry has been paying some attention to his sister.\r\nHe is much attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life\r\nwithout her, but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to\r\nstand in the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain\r\nthat he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have\r\nseveral times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from\r\nbeing tete-a-tete. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow\r\nSir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love\r\naffair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity would\r\nsoon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.\r\n\r\nThe other day--Thursday, to be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched with us.\r\nHe has been excavating a barrow at Long Down and has got a prehistoric\r\nskull which fills him with great joy. Never was there such a\r\nsingle-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came in afterwards, and\r\nthe good doctor took us all to the yew alley at Sir Henry's request to\r\nshow us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. It is\r\na long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped\r\nhedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. At the far end is\r\nan old tumble-down summer-house. Halfway down is the moor-gate, where\r\nthe old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It is a white wooden gate with\r\na latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I remembered your theory of the\r\naffair and tried to picture all that had occurred. As the old man stood\r\nthere he saw something coming across the moor, something which terrified\r\nhim so that he lost his wits and ran and ran until he died of sheer\r\nhorror and exhaustion. There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which\r\nhe fled. And from what? A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound,\r\nblack, silent, and monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter?\r\nDid the pale, watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was\r\nall dim and vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOne other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.\r\nFrankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of us.\r\nHe is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His passion\r\nis for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in litigation.\r\nHe fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is equally ready to take\r\nup either side of a question, so that it is no wonder that he has found\r\nit a costly amusement. Sometimes he will shut up a right of way and defy\r\nthe parish to make him open it. At others he will with his own hands\r\ntear down some other man's gate and declare that a path has existed\r\nthere from time immemorial, defying the owner to prosecute him for\r\ntrespass. He is learned in old manorial and communal rights, and he\r\napplies his knowledge sometimes in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy\r\nand sometimes against them, so that he is periodically either carried in\r\ntriumph down the village street or else burned in effigy, according to\r\nhis latest exploit. He is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his\r\nhands at present, which will probably swallow up the remainder of his\r\nfortune and so draw his sting and leave him harmless for the future.\r\nApart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I\r\nonly mention him because you were particular that I should send some\r\ndescription of the people who surround us. He is curiously employed\r\nat present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent\r\ntelescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps\r\nthe moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped\r\nconvict. If he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but\r\nthere are rumours that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening\r\na grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the\r\nNeolithic skull in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives\r\nfrom being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the\r\nStapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end on\r\nthat which is most important and tell you more about the Barrymores, and\r\nespecially about the surprising development of last night.\r\n\r\nFirst of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in\r\norder to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already\r\nexplained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was\r\nworthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told Sir\r\nHenry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright fashion,\r\nhad Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the telegram\r\nhimself. Barrymore said that he had.\r\n\r\n\"Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?\" asked Sir Henry.\r\n\r\nBarrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he, \"I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife brought\r\nit up to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you answer it yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\n\"I could not quite understand the object of your questions this morning,\r\nSir Henry,\" said he. \"I trust that they do not mean that I have done\r\nanything to forfeit your confidence?\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving\r\nhim a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having\r\nnow all arrived.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very\r\nlimited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You\r\ncould hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,\r\non the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then\r\nI have more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep\r\nsorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty\r\nmemory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a\r\ndomestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular\r\nand questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last\r\nnight brings all my suspicions to a head.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am\r\nnot a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house\r\nmy slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the\r\nmorning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,\r\nopened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down\r\nthe corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage\r\nwith a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no\r\ncovering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height\r\ntold me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,\r\nand there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nI have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs\r\nround the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited\r\nuntil he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came\r\nround the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and\r\nI could see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he\r\nhad entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and\r\nunoccupied so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The\r\nlight shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down\r\nthe passage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nBarrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the\r\nglass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be\r\nrigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.\r\nFor some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan\r\nand with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my\r\nway back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\r\nonce more upon their return journey. Long afterwards when I had fallen\r\ninto a light sleep I heard a key turn somewhere in a lock, but I could\r\nnot tell whence the sound came. What it all means I cannot guess, but\r\nthere is some secret business going on in this house of gloom which\r\nsooner or later we shall get to the bottom of. I do not trouble you with\r\nmy theories, for you asked me to furnish you only with facts. I have\r\nhad a long talk with Sir Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of\r\ncampaign founded upon my observations of last night. I will not speak\r\nabout it just now, but it should make my next report interesting\r\nreading.\r\n\nBaskerville Hall, Oct. 15th. MY DEAR HOLMES: If I was compelled to\r\nleave you without much news during the early days of my mission you must\r\nacknowledge that I am making up for lost time, and that events are now\r\ncrowding thick and fast upon us. In my last report I ended upon my top\r\nnote with Barrymore at the window, and now I have quite a budget already\r\nwhich will, unless I am much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things\r\nhave taken a turn which I could not have anticipated. In some ways they\r\nhave within the last forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some\r\nways they have become more complicated. But I will tell you all and you\r\nshall judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the\r\ncorridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night\r\nbefore. The western window through which he had stared so intently has,\r\nI noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house--it\r\ncommands the nearest outlook on to the moor. There is an opening between\r\ntwo trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down\r\nupon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse\r\nwhich can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since\r\nonly this window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\r\nsomething or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I\r\ncan hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck\r\nme that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would\r\nhave accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness\r\nof his wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped\r\nto steal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to\r\nhave something to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard\r\nafter I had returned to my room might mean that he had gone out to keep\r\nsome clandestine appointment. So I reasoned with myself in the morning,\r\nand I tell you the direction of my suspicions, however much the result\r\nmay have shown that they were unfounded.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the true explanation of Barrymore's movements might be,\r\nI felt that the responsibility of keeping them to myself until I could\r\nexplain them was more than I could bear. I had an interview with the\r\nbaronet in his study after breakfast, and I told him all that I had\r\nseen. He was less surprised than I had expected.\r\n\r\n\"I knew that Barrymore walked about nights, and I had a mind to speak\r\nto him about it,\" said he. \"Two or three times I have heard his steps in\r\nthe passage, coming and going, just about the hour you name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps then he pays a visit every night to that particular window,\" I\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he does. If so, we should be able to shadow him and see what\r\nit is that he is after. I wonder what your friend Holmes would do if he\r\nwere here.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that he would do exactly what you now suggest,\" said I. \"He\r\nwould follow Barrymore and see what he did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall do it together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely he would hear us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man is rather deaf, and in any case we must take our chance of\r\nthat. We'll sit up in my room tonight and wait until he passes.\" Sir\r\nHenry rubbed his hands with pleasure, and it was evident that he hailed\r\nthe adventure as a relief to his somewhat quiet life upon the moor.\r\n\r\nThe baronet has been in communication with the architect who prepared\r\nthe plans for Sir Charles, and with a contractor from London, so that we\r\nmay expect great changes to begin here soon. There have been decorators\r\nand furnishers up from Plymouth, and it is evident that our friend\r\nhas large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the\r\ngrandeur of his family. When the house is renovated and refurnished, all\r\nthat he will need will be a wife to make it complete. Between ourselves\r\nthere are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady\r\nis willing, for I have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman\r\nthan he is with our beautiful neighbour, Miss Stapleton. And yet the\r\ncourse of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under\r\nthe circumstances expect. Today, for example, its surface was broken\r\nby a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable\r\nperplexity and annoyance.\r\n\r\nAfter the conversation which I have quoted about Barrymore, Sir Henry\r\nput on his hat and prepared to go out. As a matter of course I did the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\"What, are you coming, Watson?\" he asked, looking at me in a curious\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"That depends on whether you are going on the moor,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know what my instructions are. I am sorry to intrude, but\r\nyou heard how earnestly Holmes insisted that I should not leave you, and\r\nespecially that you should not go alone upon the moor.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry put his hand upon my shoulder with a pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow,\" said he, \"Holmes, with all his wisdom, did not foresee\r\nsome things which have happened since I have been on the moor. You\r\nunderstand me? I am sure that you are the last man in the world who\r\nwould wish to be a spoil-sport. I must go out alone.\"\r\n\r\nIt put me in a most awkward position. I was at a loss what to say or\r\nwhat to do, and before I had made up my mind he picked up his cane and\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nBut when I came to think the matter over my conscience reproached me\r\nbitterly for having on any pretext allowed him to go out of my sight.\r\nI imagined what my feelings would be if I had to return to you and to\r\nconfess that some misfortune had occurred through my disregard for your\r\ninstructions. I assure you my cheeks flushed at the very thought. It\r\nmight not even now be too late to overtake him, so I set off at once in\r\nthe direction of Merripit House.\r\n\r\nI hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything\r\nof Sir Henry, until I came to the point where the moor path branches\r\noff. There, fearing that perhaps I had come in the wrong direction after\r\nall, I mounted a hill from which I could command a view--the same hill\r\nwhich is cut into the dark quarry. Thence I saw him at once. He was on\r\nthe moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side\r\nwho could only be Miss Stapleton. It was clear that there was already\r\nan understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. They\r\nwere walking slowly along in deep conversation, and I saw her making\r\nquick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what\r\nshe was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his\r\nhead in strong dissent. I stood among the rocks watching them, very much\r\npuzzled as to what I should do next. To follow them and break into their\r\nintimate conversation seemed to be an outrage, and yet my clear duty was\r\nnever for an instant to let him out of my sight. To act the spy upon a\r\nfriend was a hateful task. Still, I could see no better course than to\r\nobserve him from the hill, and to clear my conscience by confessing to\r\nhim afterwards what I had done. It is true that if any sudden danger had\r\nthreatened him I was too far away to be of use, and yet I am sure that\r\nyou will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that\r\nthere was nothing more which I could do.\r\n\r\nOur friend, Sir Henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were\r\nstanding deeply absorbed in their conversation, when I was suddenly\r\naware that I was not the only witness of their interview. A wisp of\r\ngreen floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me\r\nthat it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken\r\nground. It was Stapleton with his butterfly-net. He was very much closer\r\nto the pair than I was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction.\r\nAt this instant Sir Henry suddenly drew Miss Stapleton to his side. His\r\narm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from\r\nhim with her face averted. He stooped his head to hers, and she raised\r\none hand as if in protest. Next moment I saw them spring apart and turn\r\nhurriedly round. Stapleton was the cause of the interruption. He was\r\nrunning wildly towards them, his absurd net dangling behind him. He\r\ngesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers.\r\nWhat the scene meant I could not imagine, but it seemed to me that\r\nStapleton was abusing Sir Henry, who offered explanations, which became\r\nmore angry as the other refused to accept them. The lady stood by in\r\nhaughty silence. Finally Stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in\r\na peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at Sir\r\nHenry, walked off by the side of her brother. The naturalist's angry\r\ngestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. The\r\nbaronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly\r\nback the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of\r\ndejection.\r\n\r\nWhat all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to\r\nhave witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge. I ran\r\ndown the hill therefore and met the baronet at the bottom. His face was\r\nflushed with anger and his brows were wrinkled, like one who is at his\r\nwit's ends what to do.\r\n\r\n\"Halloa, Watson! Where have you dropped from?\" said he. \"You don't mean\r\nto say that you came after me in spite of all?\"\r\n\r\nI explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain\r\nbehind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that\r\nhad occurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness\r\ndisarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe\r\nplace for a man to be private,\" said he, \"but, by thunder, the whole\r\ncountryside seems to have been out to see me do my wooing--and a mighty\r\npoor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was on that hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front.\r\nDid you see him come out on us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he ever strike you as being crazy--this brother of hers?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't say that he ever did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until today, but you\r\ncan take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a straitjacket.\r\nWhat's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some weeks,\r\nWatson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would prevent me\r\nfrom making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say not.\"\r\n\r\n\"He can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he\r\nhas this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in\r\nmy life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the\r\ntips of her fingers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say so?\"\r\n\r\n\"That, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these\r\nfew weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me,\r\nand she, too--she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear.\r\nThere's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But he\r\nhas never let us get together and it was only today for the first time\r\nthat I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was glad\r\nto meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk about,\r\nand she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could have\r\nstopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of danger,\r\nand that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told her that\r\nsince I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if she\r\nreally wanted me to go, the only way to work it was for her to arrange\r\nto go with me. With that I offered in as many words to marry her, but\r\nbefore she could answer, down came this brother of hers, running at us\r\nwith a face on him like a madman. He was just white with rage, and those\r\nlight eyes of his were blazing with fury. What was I doing with the\r\nlady? How dared I offer her attentions which were distasteful to her?\r\nDid I think that because I was a baronet I could do what I liked? If he\r\nhad not been her brother I should have known better how to answer him.\r\nAs it was I told him that my feelings towards his sister were such as\r\nI was not ashamed of, and that I hoped that she might honour me by\r\nbecoming my wife. That seemed to make the matter no better, so then I\r\nlost my temper too, and I answered him rather more hotly than I should\r\nperhaps, considering that she was standing by. So it ended by his going\r\noff with her, as you saw, and here am I as badly puzzled a man as any\r\nin this county. Just tell me what it all means, Watson, and I'll owe you\r\nmore than ever I can hope to pay.\"\r\n\r\nI tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled\r\nmyself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and his\r\nappearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him unless\r\nit be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances should\r\nbe rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own wishes\r\nand that the lady should accept the situation without protest is very\r\namazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit from\r\nStapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer apologies\r\nfor his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private interview with\r\nSir Henry in his study the upshot of their conversation was that the\r\nbreach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit House next\r\nFriday as a sign of it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man,\" said Sir Henry; \"I can't\r\nforget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I must\r\nallow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he give any explanation of his conduct?\"\r\n\r\n\"His sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,\r\nand I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been\r\ntogether, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man\r\nwith only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was\r\nreally terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was\r\nbecoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was\r\nreally so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a\r\nshock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did.\r\nHe was very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish\r\nand how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\r\nbeautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she\r\nhad to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to\r\nanyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him and it would take him\r\nsome time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw\r\nall opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let\r\nthe matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's friendship\r\nduring that time without claiming her love. This I promised, and so the\r\nmatter rests.\"\r\n\r\nSo there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to\r\nhave touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering.\r\nWe know now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's\r\nsuitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And\r\nnow I pass on to another thread which I have extricated out of the\r\ntangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained\r\nface of Mrs. Barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the\r\nwestern lattice window. Congratulate me, my dear Holmes, and tell me\r\nthat I have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret\r\nthe confidence which you showed in me when you sent me down. All these\r\nthings have by one night's work been thoroughly cleared.\r\n\r\nI have said \"by one night's work,\" but, in truth, it was by two nights'\r\nwork, for on the first we drew entirely blank. I sat up with Sir Henry\r\nin his rooms until nearly three o'clock in the morning, but no sound of\r\nany sort did we hear except the chiming clock upon the stairs. It was\r\na most melancholy vigil and ended by each of us falling asleep in our\r\nchairs. Fortunately we were not discouraged, and we determined to try\r\nagain. The next night we lowered the lamp and sat smoking cigarettes\r\nwithout making the least sound. It was incredible how slowly the hours\r\ncrawled by, and yet we were helped through it by the same sort of\r\npatient interest which the hunter must feel as he watches the trap into\r\nwhich he hopes the game may wander. One struck, and two, and we had\r\nalmost for the second time given it up in despair when in an instant we\r\nboth sat bolt upright in our chairs with all our weary senses keenly on\r\nthe alert once more. We had heard the creak of a step in the passage.\r\n\r\nVery stealthily we heard it pass along until it died away in the\r\ndistance. Then the baronet gently opened his door and we set out in\r\npursuit. Already our man had gone round the gallery and the corridor was\r\nall in darkness. Softly we stole along until we had come into the other\r\nwing. We were just in time to catch a glimpse of the tall, black-bearded\r\nfigure, his shoulders rounded as he tiptoed down the passage. Then he\r\npassed through the same door as before, and the light of the candle\r\nframed it in the darkness and shot one single yellow beam across the\r\ngloom of the corridor. We shuffled cautiously towards it, trying every\r\nplank before we dared to put our whole weight upon it. We had taken the\r\nprecaution of leaving our boots behind us, but, even so, the old boards\r\nsnapped and creaked beneath our tread. Sometimes it seemed impossible\r\nthat he should fail to hear our approach. However, the man is\r\nfortunately rather deaf, and he was entirely preoccupied in that which\r\nhe was doing. When at last we reached the door and peeped through we\r\nfound him crouching at the window, candle in hand, his white, intent\r\nface pressed against the pane, exactly as I had seen him two nights\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWe had arranged no plan of campaign, but the baronet is a man to whom\r\nthe most direct way is always the most natural. He walked into the room,\r\nand as he did so Barrymore sprang up from the window with a sharp hiss\r\nof his breath and stood, livid and trembling, before us. His dark eyes,\r\nglaring out of the white mask of his face, were full of horror and\r\nastonishment as he gazed from Sir Henry to me.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here, Barrymore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, sir.\" His agitation was so great that he could hardly speak,\r\nand the shadows sprang up and down from the shaking of his candle. \"It\r\nwas the window, sir. I go round at night to see that they are fastened.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the second floor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, all the windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Barrymore,\" said Sir Henry sternly, \"we have made up our\r\nminds to have the truth out of you, so it will save you trouble to tell\r\nit sooner rather than later. Come, now! No lies! What were you doing at\r\nthat window?\"\r\n\r\nThe fellow looked at us in a helpless way, and he wrung his hands\r\ntogether like one who is in the last extremity of doubt and misery.\r\n\r\n\"I was doing no harm, sir. I was holding a candle to the window.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why were you holding a candle to the window?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me, Sir Henry--don't ask me! I give you my word, sir, that it\r\nis not my secret, and that I cannot tell it. If it concerned no one but\r\nmyself I would not try to keep it from you.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden idea occurred to me, and I took the candle from the trembling\r\nhand of the butler.\r\n\r\n\"He must have been holding it as a signal,\" said I. \"Let us see if\r\nthere is any answer.\" I held it as he had done, and stared out into the\r\ndarkness of the night. Vaguely I could discern the black bank of the\r\ntrees and the lighter expanse of the moor, for the moon was behind the\r\nclouds. And then I gave a cry of exultation, for a tiny pinpoint of\r\nyellow light had suddenly transfixed the dark veil, and glowed steadily\r\nin the centre of the black square framed by the window.\r\n\r\n\"There it is!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, sir, it is nothing--nothing at all!\" the butler broke in; \"I\r\nassure you, sir--\"\r\n\r\n\"Move your light across the window, Watson!\" cried the baronet. \"See,\r\nthe other moves also! Now, you rascal, do you deny that it is a signal?\r\nCome, speak up! Who is your confederate out yonder, and what is this\r\nconspiracy that is going on?\"\r\n\r\nThe man's face became openly defiant. \"It is my business, and not yours.\r\nI will not tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you leave my employment right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, sir. If I must I must.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you go in disgrace. By thunder, you may well be ashamed of\r\nyourself. Your family has lived with mine for over a hundred years under\r\nthis roof, and here I find you deep in some dark plot against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, sir; no, not against you!\" It was a woman's voice, and Mrs.\r\nBarrymore, paler and more horror-struck than her husband, was standing\r\nat the door. Her bulky figure in a shawl and skirt might have been comic\r\nwere it not for the intensity of feeling upon her face.\r\n\r\n\"We have to go, Eliza. This is the end of it. You can pack our things,\"\r\nsaid the butler.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, John, John, have I brought you to this? It is my doing, Sir\r\nHenry--all mine. He has done nothing except for my sake and because I\r\nasked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak out, then! What does it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"My unhappy brother is starving on the moor. We cannot let him perish at\r\nour very gates. The light is a signal to him that food is ready for him,\r\nand his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then your brother is--\"\r\n\r\n\"The escaped convict, sir--Selden, the criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the truth, sir,\" said Barrymore. \"I said that it was not my\r\nsecret and that I could not tell it to you. But now you have heard it,\r\nand you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night\r\nand the light at the window. Sir Henry and I both stared at the woman in\r\namazement. Was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of\r\nthe same blood as one of the most notorious criminals in the country?\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, my name was Selden, and he is my younger brother. We humoured\r\nhim too much when he was a lad and gave him his own way in everything\r\nuntil he came to think that the world was made for his pleasure, and\r\nthat he could do what he liked in it. Then as he grew older he met\r\nwicked companions, and the devil entered into him until he broke my\r\nmother's heart and dragged our name in the dirt. From crime to crime\r\nhe sank lower and lower until it is only the mercy of God which has\r\nsnatched him from the scaffold; but to me, sir, he was always the little\r\ncurly-headed boy that I had nursed and played with as an elder sister\r\nwould. That was why he broke prison, sir. He knew that I was here and\r\nthat we could not refuse to help him. When he dragged himself here one\r\nnight, weary and starving, with the warders hard at his heels, what\r\ncould we do? We took him in and fed him and cared for him. Then you\r\nreturned, sir, and my brother thought he would be safer on the moor than\r\nanywhere else until the hue and cry was over, so he lay in hiding there.\r\nBut every second night we made sure if he was still there by putting a\r\nlight in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some\r\nbread and meat to him. Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long\r\nas he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I\r\nam an honest Christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in\r\nthe matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake\r\nhe has done all that he has.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried\r\nconviction with them.\r\n\r\n\"Is this true, Barrymore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what\r\nI have said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about\r\nthis matter in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone we looked out of the window again. Sir Henry had\r\nflung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. Far away\r\nin the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder he dares,\" said Sir Henry.\r\n\r\n\"It may be so placed as to be only visible from here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely. How far do you think it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out by the Cleft Tor, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than a mile or two off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.\r\nAnd he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson,\r\nI am going out to take that man!\"\r\n\r\nThe same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\r\nBarrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been\r\nforced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated\r\nscoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing\r\nour duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no\r\nharm. With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the\r\nprice if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the\r\nStapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of\r\nthis which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\r\n\r\n\"I will come,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"Then get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the\r\nbetter, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.\r\nWe hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the\r\nautumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was\r\nheavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped\r\nout for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,\r\nand just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light\r\nstill burned steadily in front.\r\n\r\n\"Are you armed?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"I have a hunting-crop.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must close in on him rapidly, for he is said to be a desperate\r\nfellow. We shall take him by surprise and have him at our mercy before\r\nhe can resist.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, Watson,\" said the baronet, \"what would Holmes say to this? How\r\nabout that hour of darkness in which the power of evil is exalted?\"\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to his words there rose suddenly out of the vast gloom\r\nof the moor that strange cry which I had already heard upon the borders\r\nof the great Grimpen Mire. It came with the wind through the silence\r\nof the night, a long, deep mutter, then a rising howl, and then the sad\r\nmoan in which it died away. Again and again it sounded, the whole air\r\nthrobbing with it, strident, wild, and menacing. The baronet caught my\r\nsleeve and his face glimmered white through the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"My God, what's that, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. It's a sound they have on the moor. I heard it once\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\nIt died away, and an absolute silence closed in upon us. We stood\r\nstraining our ears, but nothing came.\r\n\r\n\"Watson,\" said the baronet, \"it was the cry of a hound.\"\r\n\r\nMy blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice which\r\ntold of the sudden horror which had seized him.\r\n\r\n\"What do they call this sound?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"The folk on the countryside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they are ignorant people. Why should you mind what they call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Watson. What do they say of it?\"\r\n\r\nI hesitated but could not escape the question.\r\n\r\n\"They say it is the cry of the Hound of the Baskervilles.\"\r\n\r\nHe groaned and was silent for a few moments.\r\n\r\n\"A hound it was,\" he said at last, \"but it seemed to come from miles\r\naway, over yonder, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was hard to say whence it came.\"\r\n\r\n\"It rose and fell with the wind. Isn't that the direction of the great\r\nGrimpen Mire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was up there. Come now, Watson, didn't you think yourself that\r\nit was the cry of a hound? I am not a child. You need not fear to speak\r\nthe truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stapleton was with me when I heard it last. He said that it might be\r\nthe calling of a strange bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, it was a hound. My God, can there be some truth in all these\r\nstories? Is it possible that I am really in danger from so dark a cause?\r\nYou don't believe it, do you, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it was one thing to laugh about it in London, and it is another\r\nto stand out here in the darkness of the moor and to hear such a cry as\r\nthat. And my uncle! There was the footprint of the hound beside him as\r\nhe lay. It all fits together. I don't think that I am a coward, Watson,\r\nbut that sound seemed to freeze my very blood. Feel my hand!\"\r\n\r\nIt was as cold as a block of marble.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be all right tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise that\r\nwe do now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we turn back?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We\r\nafter the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come\r\non! We'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon\r\nthe moor.\"\r\n\r\nWe stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the\r\ncraggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily\r\nin front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon\r\na pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon\r\nthe horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.\r\nBut at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were\r\nindeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the\r\nrocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it\r\nand also to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\r\nBaskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and\r\ncrouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange\r\nto see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with\r\nno sign of life near it--just the one straight yellow flame and the\r\ngleam of the rock on each side of it.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" whispered Sir Henry.\r\n\r\n\"Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\r\nglimpse of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the\r\nrocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out\r\nan evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with\r\nvile passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with\r\nmatted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages\r\nwho dwelt in the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him was\r\nreflected in his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and\r\nleft through the darkness like a crafty and savage animal who has heard\r\nthe steps of the hunters.\r\n\r\nSomething had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that\r\nBarrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or\r\nthe fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not\r\nwell, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he\r\nmight dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward\r\ntherefore, and Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict\r\nscreamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against\r\nthe boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short,\r\nsquat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run.\r\nAt the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.\r\nWe rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with\r\ngreat speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way\r\nwith the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my revolver\r\nmight have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend myself if\r\nattacked and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running away.\r\n\r\nWe were both swift runners and in fairly good training, but we soon\r\nfound that we had no chance of overtaking him. We saw him for a long\r\ntime in the moonlight until he was only a small speck moving swiftly\r\namong the boulders upon the side of a distant hill. We ran and ran until\r\nwe were completely blown, but the space between us grew ever wider.\r\nFinally we stopped and sat panting on two rocks, while we watched him\r\ndisappearing in the distance.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this moment that there occurred a most strange and\r\nunexpected thing. We had risen from our rocks and were turning to go\r\nhome, having abandoned the hopeless chase. The moon was low upon the\r\nright, and the jagged pinnacle of a granite tor stood up against the\r\nlower curve of its silver disc. There, outlined as black as an ebony\r\nstatue on that shining background, I saw the figure of a man upon the\r\ntor. Do not think that it was a delusion, Holmes. I assure you that\r\nI have never in my life seen anything more clearly. As far as I could\r\njudge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. He stood with his legs\r\na little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were\r\nbrooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay\r\nbefore him. He might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.\r\nIt was not the convict. This man was far from the place where the\r\nlatter had disappeared. Besides, he was a much taller man. With a cry\r\nof surprise I pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during\r\nwhich I had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. There was the\r\nsharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but\r\nits peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.\r\n\r\nI wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some\r\ndistance away. The baronet's nerves were still quivering from that cry,\r\nwhich recalled the dark story of his family, and he was not in the mood\r\nfor fresh adventures. He had not seen this lonely man upon the tor and\r\ncould not feel the thrill which his strange presence and his commanding\r\nattitude had given to me. \"A warder, no doubt,\" said he. \"The moor\r\nhas been thick with them since this fellow escaped.\" Well, perhaps his\r\nexplanation may be the right one, but I should like to have some further\r\nproof of it. Today we mean to communicate to the Princetown people where\r\nthey should look for their missing man, but it is hard lines that\r\nwe have not actually had the triumph of bringing him back as our\r\nown prisoner. Such are the adventures of last night, and you must\r\nacknowledge, my dear Holmes, that I have done you very well in\r\nthe matter of a report. Much of what I tell you is no doubt quite\r\nirrelevant, but still I feel that it is best that I should let you have\r\nall the facts and leave you to select for yourself those which will\r\nbe of most service to you in helping you to your conclusions. We are\r\ncertainly making some progress. So far as the Barrymores go we have\r\nfound the motive of their actions, and that has cleared up the situation\r\nvery much. But the moor with its mysteries and its strange inhabitants\r\nremains as inscrutable as ever. Perhaps in my next I may be able to\r\nthrow some light upon this also. Best of all would it be if you could\r\ncome down to us. In any case you will hear from me again in the course\r\nof the next few days.\r\n\nSo far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded\r\nduring these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived\r\nat a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method\r\nand to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which\r\nI kept at the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to\r\nthose scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I\r\nproceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\r\nconvict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\r\n\r\nOctober 16th. A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The house\r\nis banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the\r\ndreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the\r\nhills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon\r\ntheir wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a\r\nblack reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself\r\nof a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger--ever present\r\ndanger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.\r\n\r\nAnd have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of\r\nincidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is\r\nat work around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,\r\nfulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there\r\nare the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange\r\ncreature upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound\r\nwhich resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible,\r\nimpossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of\r\nnature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the\r\nair with its howling is surely not to be thought of. Stapleton may\r\nfall in with such a superstition, and Mortimer also, but if I have one\r\nquality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to\r\nbelieve in such a thing. To do so would be to descend to the level of\r\nthese poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must\r\nneeds describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.\r\nHolmes would not listen to such fancies, and I am his agent. But facts\r\nare facts, and I have twice heard this crying upon the moor. Suppose\r\nthat there were really some huge hound loose upon it; that would go far\r\nto explain everything. But where could such a hound lie concealed, where\r\ndid it get its food, where did it come from, how was it that no one\r\nsaw it by day? It must be confessed that the natural explanation offers\r\nalmost as many difficulties as the other. And always, apart from the\r\nhound, there is the fact of the human agency in London, the man in the\r\ncab, and the letter which warned Sir Henry against the moor. This at\r\nleast was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend\r\nas easily as of an enemy. Where is that friend or enemy now? Has he\r\nremained in London, or has he followed us down here? Could he--could he\r\nbe the stranger whom I saw upon the tor?\r\n\r\nIt is true that I have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are\r\nsome things to which I am ready to swear. He is no one whom I have seen\r\ndown here, and I have now met all the neighbours. The figure was far\r\ntaller than that of Stapleton, far thinner than that of Frankland.\r\nBarrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,\r\nand I am certain that he could not have followed us. A stranger then is\r\nstill dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in London. We have never\r\nshaken him off. If I could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we\r\nmight find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\r\npurpose I must now devote all my energies.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and\r\nwisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to\r\nanyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken\r\nby that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties,\r\nbut I will take my own steps to attain my own end.\r\n\r\nWe had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave\r\nto speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little\r\ntime. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of\r\nvoices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was\r\nunder discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called\r\nfor me. \"Barrymore considers that he has a grievance,\" he said. \"He\r\nthinks that it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down\r\nwhen he, of his own free will, had told us the secret.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\r\n\r\n\"I may have spoken too warmly, sir,\" said he, \"and if I have, I am sure\r\nthat I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised when\r\nI heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that you\r\nhad been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against\r\nwithout my putting more upon his track.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had told us of your own free will it would have been a different\r\nthing,\" said the baronet, \"you only told us, or rather your wife only\r\ntold us, when it was forced from you and you could not help yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir Henry--indeed\r\nI didn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the\r\nmoor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to\r\nget a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton's house,\r\nfor example, with no one but himself to defend it. There's no safety for\r\nanyone until he is under lock and key.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.\r\nBut he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you,\r\nSir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have\r\nbeen made and he will be on his way to South America. For God's sake,\r\nsir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the\r\nmoor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the\r\nship is ready for him. You can't tell on him without getting my wife and\r\nme into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Watson?\"\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. \"If he were safely out of the country it would\r\nrelieve the tax-payer of a burden.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?\"\r\n\r\n\"He would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all\r\nthat he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was\r\nhiding.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Sir Henry. \"Well, Barrymore--\"\r\n\r\n\"God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed\r\nmy poor wife had he been taken again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what\r\nwe have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is an\r\nend of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.\"\r\n\r\nWith a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated\r\nand then came back.\r\n\r\n\"You've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I\r\ncan for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should\r\nhave said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it\r\nout. I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It's about\r\npoor Sir Charles's death.\"\r\n\r\nThe baronet and I were both upon our feet. \"Do you know how he died?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, I don't know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"To meet a woman! He?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the woman's name?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her\r\ninitials were L. L.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know this, Barrymore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually a\r\ngreat many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his kind\r\nheart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him. But\r\nthat morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I took\r\nthe more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was addressed\r\nin a woman's hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done\r\nhad it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out\r\nSir Charles's study--it had never been touched since his death--and she\r\nfound the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The greater\r\npart of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end of a\r\npage, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it was\r\ngray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the end\r\nof the letter and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\r\nthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath it were signed\r\nthe initials L. L.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got that slip?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not\r\nhave noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have no idea who L. L. is?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands\r\nupon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot understand, Barrymore, how you came to conceal this important\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it was immediately after that our own trouble came to us.\r\nAnd then again, sir, we were both of us very fond of Sir Charles, as we\r\nwell might be considering all that he has done for us. To rake this\r\nup couldn't help our poor master, and it's well to go carefully when\r\nthere's a lady in the case. Even the best of us--\"\r\n\r\n\"You thought it might injure his reputation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I thought no good could come of it. But now you have been\r\nkind to us, and I feel as if it would be treating you unfairly not to\r\ntell you all that I know about the matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Barrymore; you can go.\" When the butler had left us Sir\r\nHenry turned to me. \"Well, Watson, what do you think of this new light?\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to leave the darkness rather blacker than before.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I think. But if we can only trace L. L. it should clear up the whole\r\nbusiness. We have gained that much. We know that there is someone who\r\nhas the facts if we can only find her. What do you think we should do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let Holmes know all about it at once. It will give him the clue for\r\nwhich he has been seeking. I am much mistaken if it does not bring him\r\ndown.\"\r\n\r\nI went at once to my room and drew up my report of the morning's\r\nconversation for Holmes. It was evident to me that he had been very busy\r\nof late, for the notes which I had from Baker Street were few and short,\r\nwith no comments upon the information which I had supplied and hardly\r\nany reference to my mission. No doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing\r\nall his faculties. And yet this new factor must surely arrest his\r\nattention and renew his interest. I wish that he were here.\r\n\r\nOctober 17th. All day today the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy\r\nand dripping from the eaves. I thought of the convict out upon the\r\nbleak, cold, shelterless moor. Poor devil! Whatever his crimes, he has\r\nsuffered something to atone for them. And then I thought of that other\r\none--the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. Was he also out\r\nin that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? In the evening\r\nI put on my waterproof and I walked far upon the sodden moor, full of\r\ndark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling\r\nabout my ears. God help those who wander into the great mire now, for\r\neven the firm uplands are becoming a morass. I found the black tor upon\r\nwhich I had seen the solitary watcher, and from its craggy summit I\r\nlooked out myself across the melancholy downs. Rain squalls drifted\r\nacross their russet face, and the heavy, slate-coloured clouds hung\r\nlow over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the\r\nfantastic hills. In the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the\r\nmist, the two thin towers of Baskerville Hall rose above the trees. They\r\nwere the only signs of human life which I could see, save only those\r\nprehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. Nowhere\r\nwas there any trace of that lonely man whom I had seen on the same spot\r\ntwo nights before.\r\n\r\nAs I walked back I was overtaken by Dr. Mortimer driving in his dog-cart\r\nover a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of\r\nFoulmire. He has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed\r\nthat he has not called at the Hall to see how we were getting on. He\r\ninsisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift\r\nhomeward. I found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little\r\nspaniel. It had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. I\r\ngave him such consolation as I might, but I thought of the pony on the\r\nGrimpen Mire, and I do not fancy that he will see his little dog again.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Mortimer,\" said I as we jolted along the rough road, \"I\r\nsuppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom\r\nyou do not know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hardly any, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are L. L.?\"\r\n\r\nHe thought for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he. \"There are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom\r\nI can't answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose\r\ninitials are those. Wait a bit though,\" he added after a pause. \"There\r\nis Laura Lyons--her initials are L. L.--but she lives in Coombe Tracey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is she?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"She is Frankland's daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Old Frankland the crank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. She married an artist named Lyons, who came sketching on the\r\nmoor. He proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. The fault from what\r\nI hear may not have been entirely on one side. Her father refused to\r\nhave anything to do with her because she had married without his consent\r\nand perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. So, between the old\r\nsinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does she live?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,\r\nfor his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have\r\ndeserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. Her story\r\ngot about, and several of the people here did something to enable her\r\nto earn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for\r\nanother. I gave a trifle myself. It was to set her up in a typewriting\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nHe wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy\r\nhis curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why\r\nwe should take anyone into our confidence. Tomorrow morning I shall\r\nfind my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of\r\nequivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing\r\none incident in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the\r\nwisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an\r\ninconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull\r\nbelonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.\r\nI have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\r\n\r\nI have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and\r\nmelancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which\r\ngives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.\r\n\r\nMortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte\r\nafterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took\r\nthe chance to ask him a few questions.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said I, \"has this precious relation of yours departed, or is he\r\nstill lurking out yonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\r\nbrought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him since I left out\r\nfood for him last, and that was three days ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see him then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he was certainly there?\"\r\n\r\n\"So you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.\"\r\n\r\nI sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.\r\n\r\n\"You know that there is another man then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know of him then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in hiding, too,\r\nbut he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I don't like it, Dr.\r\nWatson--I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it.\" He spoke with a\r\nsudden passion of earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Now, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but\r\nthat of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him.\r\nTell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like.\"\r\n\r\nBarrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or\r\nfound it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\r\n\r\n\"It's all these goings-on, sir,\" he cried at last, waving his hand\r\ntowards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. \"There's foul play\r\nsomewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll swear!\r\nVery glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to London\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it that alarms you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all that the\r\ncoroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There's not a\r\nman would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this\r\nstranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he waiting\r\nfor? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of\r\nBaskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day\r\nthat Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"But about this stranger,\" said I. \"Can you tell me anything about\r\nhim? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was\r\ndoing?\"\r\n\r\n\"He saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one and gives nothing away.\r\nAt first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that he\r\nhad some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he could\r\nsee, but what he was doing he could not make out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And where did he say that he lived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Among the old houses on the hillside--the stone huts where the old folk\r\nused to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about his food?\"\r\n\r\n\"Selden found out that he has got a lad who works for him and brings all\r\nhe needs. I dare say he goes to Coombe Tracey for what he wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Barrymore. We may talk further of this some other time.\"\r\nWhen the butler had gone I walked over to the black window, and I looked\r\nthrough a blurred pane at the driving clouds and at the tossing outline\r\nof the wind-swept trees. It is a wild night indoors, and what must it\r\nbe in a stone hut upon the moor. What passion of hatred can it be which\r\nleads a man to lurk in such a place at such a time! And what deep and\r\nearnest purpose can he have which calls for such a trial! There, in that\r\nhut upon the moor, seems to lie the very centre of that problem which\r\nhas vexed me so sorely. I swear that another day shall not have passed\r\nbefore I have done all that man can do to reach the heart of the\r\nmystery.\r\n\nThe extract from my private diary which forms the last chapter has\r\nbrought my narrative up to the eighteenth of October, a time when these\r\nstrange events began to move swiftly towards their terrible conclusion.\r\nThe incidents of the next few days are indelibly graven upon my\r\nrecollection, and I can tell them without reference to the notes made\r\nat the time. I start them from the day which succeeded that upon which\r\nI had established two facts of great importance, the one that Mrs. Laura\r\nLyons of Coombe Tracey had written to Sir Charles Baskerville and made\r\nan appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his\r\ndeath, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found\r\namong the stone huts upon the hillside. With these two facts in my\r\npossession I felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be\r\ndeficient if I could not throw some further light upon these dark\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI had no opportunity to tell the baronet what I had learned about Mrs.\r\nLyons upon the evening before, for Dr. Mortimer remained with him at\r\ncards until it was very late. At breakfast, however, I informed him\r\nabout my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany\r\nme to Coombe Tracey. At first he was very eager to come, but on second\r\nthoughts it seemed to both of us that if I went alone the results might\r\nbe better. The more formal we made the visit the less information we\r\nmight obtain. I left Sir Henry behind, therefore, not without some\r\nprickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached Coombe Tracey I told Perkins to put up the horses, and\r\nI made inquiries for the lady whom I had come to interrogate. I had no\r\ndifficulty in finding her rooms, which were central and well appointed.\r\nA maid showed me in without ceremony, and as I entered the sitting-room\r\na lady, who was sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a\r\npleasant smile of welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that\r\nI was a stranger, and she sat down again and asked me the object of my\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\nThe first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her\r\neyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though\r\nconsiderably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the\r\nbrunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.\r\nAdmiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was\r\ncriticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some\r\ncoarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness\r\nof lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\r\nafterthoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in\r\nthe presence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the\r\nreasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how\r\ndelicate my mission was.\r\n\r\n\"I have the pleasure,\" said I, \"of knowing your father.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a clumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it. \"There\r\nis nothing in common between my father and me,\" she said. \"I owe him\r\nnothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the late Sir\r\nCharles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have starved for\r\nall that my father cared.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to\r\nsee you.\"\r\n\r\nThe freckles started out on the lady's face.\r\n\r\n\"What can I tell you about him?\" she asked, and her fingers played\r\nnervously over the stops of her typewriter.\r\n\r\n\"You knew him, did you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am\r\nable to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took\r\nin my unhappy situation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you correspond with him?\"\r\n\r\nThe lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\r\n\r\n\"What is the object of these questions?\" she asked sharply.\r\n\r\n\"The object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should ask\r\nthem here than that the matter should pass outside our control.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up\r\nwith something reckless and defiant in her manner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll answer,\" she said. \"What are your questions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you correspond with Sir Charles?\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and\r\nhis generosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you the dates of those letters?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever met him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very\r\nretiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know\r\nenough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has\r\ndone?\"\r\n\r\nShe met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\r\n\r\n\"There were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to\r\nhelp me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir\r\nCharles's. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir\r\nCharles learned about my affairs.\"\r\n\r\nI knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his\r\nalmoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the impress\r\nof truth upon it.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you?\" I continued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lyons flushed with anger again. \"Really, sir, this is a very\r\nextraordinary question.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I answer, certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on the very day of Sir Charles's death?\"\r\n\r\nThe flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her\r\ndry lips could not speak the \"No\" which I saw rather than heard.\r\n\r\n\"Surely your memory deceives you,\" said I. \"I could even quote a passage\r\nof your letter. It ran 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman, burn\r\nthis letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.'\"\r\n\r\nI thought that she had fainted, but she recovered herself by a supreme\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\"Is there no such thing as a gentleman?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\n\"You do Sir Charles an injustice. He did burn the letter. But sometimes\r\na letter may be legible even when burned. You acknowledge now that you\r\nwrote it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I did write it,\" she cried, pouring out her soul in a torrent of\r\nwords. \"I did write it. Why should I deny it? I have no reason to be\r\nashamed of it. I wished him to help me. I believed that if I had an\r\ninterview I could gain his help, so I asked him to meet me.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why at such an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I had only just learned that he was going to London next day\r\nand might be away for months. There were reasons why I could not get\r\nthere earlier.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why a rendezvous in the garden instead of a visit to the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think a woman could go alone at that hour to a bachelor's\r\nhouse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happened when you did get there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never went.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lyons!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I swear it to you on all I hold sacred. I never went. Something\r\nintervened to prevent my going.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at\r\nthe very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you\r\nkept the appointment.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the truth.\"\r\n\r\nAgain and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Lyons,\" said I as I rose from this long and inconclusive\r\ninterview, \"you are taking a very great responsibility and putting\r\nyourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean\r\nbreast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police\r\nyou will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is\r\ninnocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir\r\nCharles upon that date?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and\r\nthat I might find myself involved in a scandal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your\r\nletter?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have read the letter you will know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not say that I had read all the letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You quoted some of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it\r\nwas not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so\r\npressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received\r\non the day of his death.\"\r\n\r\n\"The matter is a very private one.\"\r\n\r\n\"The more reason why you should avoid a public investigation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you, then. If you have heard anything of my unhappy history\r\nyou will know that I made a rash marriage and had reason to regret it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard so much.\"\r\n\r\n\"My life has been one incessant persecution from a husband whom I abhor.\r\nThe law is upon his side, and every day I am faced by the possibility\r\nthat he may force me to live with him. At the time that I wrote this\r\nletter to Sir Charles I had learned that there was a prospect of\r\nmy regaining my freedom if certain expenses could be met. It meant\r\neverything to me--peace of mind, happiness, self-respect--everything. I\r\nknew Sir Charles's generosity, and I thought that if he heard the story\r\nfrom my own lips he would help me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how is it that you did not go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I received help in the interval from another source.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why then, did you not write to Sir Charles and explain this?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I should have done had I not seen his death in the paper next\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman's story hung coherently together, and all my questions were\r\nunable to shake it. I could only check it by finding if she had, indeed,\r\ninstituted divorce proceedings against her husband at or about the time\r\nof the tragedy.\r\n\r\nIt was unlikely that she would dare to say that she had not been to\r\nBaskerville Hall if she really had been, for a trap would be necessary\r\nto take her there, and could not have returned to Coombe Tracey until\r\nthe early hours of the morning. Such an excursion could not be kept\r\nsecret. The probability was, therefore, that she was telling the truth,\r\nor, at least, a part of the truth. I came away baffled and disheartened.\r\nOnce again I had reached that dead wall which seemed to be built across\r\nevery path by which I tried to get at the object of my mission. And yet\r\nthe more I thought of the lady's face and of her manner the more I felt\r\nthat something was being held back from me. Why should she turn so pale?\r\nWhy should she fight against every admission until it was forced from\r\nher? Why should she have been so reticent at the time of the tragedy?\r\nSurely the explanation of all this could not be as innocent as she\r\nwould have me believe. For the moment I could proceed no farther in that\r\ndirection, but must turn back to that other clue which was to be sought\r\nfor among the stone huts upon the moor.\r\n\r\nAnd that was a most vague direction. I realized it as I drove back\r\nand noted how hill after hill showed traces of the ancient people.\r\nBarrymore's only indication had been that the stranger lived in one of\r\nthese abandoned huts, and many hundreds of them are scattered throughout\r\nthe length and breadth of the moor. But I had my own experience for a\r\nguide since it had shown me the man himself standing upon the summit of\r\nthe Black Tor. That, then, should be the centre of my search. From there\r\nI should explore every hut upon the moor until I lighted upon the right\r\none. If this man were inside it I should find out from his own lips, at\r\nthe point of my revolver if necessary, who he was and why he had dogged\r\nus so long. He might slip away from us in the crowd of Regent Street,\r\nbut it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. On the other\r\nhand, if I should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it I\r\nmust remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. Holmes had\r\nmissed him in London. It would indeed be a triumph for me if I could run\r\nhim to earth where my master had failed.\r\n\r\nLuck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at\r\nlast it came to my aid. And the messenger of good fortune was none other\r\nthan Mr. Frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,\r\noutside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along\r\nwhich I travelled.\r\n\r\n\"Good-day, Dr. Watson,\" cried he with unwonted good humour, \"you must\r\nreally give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and\r\nto congratulate me.\"\r\n\r\nMy feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what I\r\nhad heard of his treatment of his daughter, but I was anxious to send\r\nPerkins and the wagonette home, and the opportunity was a good one. I\r\nalighted and sent a message to Sir Henry that I should walk over in time\r\nfor dinner. Then I followed Frankland into his dining-room.\r\n\r\n\"It is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,\"\r\nhe cried with many chuckles. \"I have brought off a double event. I mean\r\nto teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man\r\nhere who does not fear to invoke it. I have established a right of way\r\nthrough the centre of old Middleton's park, slap across it, sir, within\r\na hundred yards of his own front door. What do you think of that? We'll\r\nteach these magnates that they cannot ride roughshod over the rights\r\nof the commoners, confound them! And I've closed the wood where the\r\nFernworthy folk used to picnic. These infernal people seem to think that\r\nthere are no rights of property, and that they can swarm where they like\r\nwith their papers and their bottles. Both cases decided, Dr. Watson, and\r\nboth in my favour. I haven't had such a day since I had Sir John Morland\r\nfor trespass because he shot in his own warren.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth did you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading--Frankland v.\r\nMorland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my\r\nverdict.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did it do you any good?\"\r\n\r\n\"None, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\r\nmatter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for\r\nexample, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight.\r\nI told the police last time they did it that they should stop these\r\ndisgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous\r\nstate, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am\r\nentitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before\r\nthe attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion\r\nto regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nThe old man put on a very knowing expression. \"Because I could tell them\r\nwhat they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the\r\nrascals in any way.\"\r\n\r\nI had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away\r\nfrom his gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen\r\nenough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any\r\nstrong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.\r\n\r\n\"Some poaching case, no doubt?\" said I with an indifferent manner.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! What about\r\nthe convict on the moor?\"\r\n\r\nI stared. \"You don't mean that you know where he is?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"I may not know exactly where he is, but I am quite sure that I could\r\nhelp the police to lay their hands on him. Has it never struck you that\r\nthe way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so\r\ntrace it to him?\"\r\n\r\nHe certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. \"No\r\ndoubt,\" said I; \"but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it because I have seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes\r\nhim his food.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart sank for Barrymore. It was a serious thing to be in the power\r\nof this spiteful old busybody. But his next remark took a weight from my\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.\r\nI see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. He passes along\r\nthe same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to\r\nthe convict?\"\r\n\r\nHere was luck indeed! And yet I suppressed all appearance of interest. A\r\nchild! Barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. It was\r\non his track, and not upon the convict's, that Frankland had stumbled.\r\nIf I could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. But\r\nincredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.\r\n\r\n\"I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of\r\nthe moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThe least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.\r\nHis eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like\r\nthose of an angry cat.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir!\" said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor. \"Do\r\nyou see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill beyond\r\nwith the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole moor.\r\nIs that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his station?\r\nYour suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.\"\r\n\r\nI meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My\r\nsubmission pleased him and led him to further confidences.\r\n\r\n\"You may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to an\r\nopinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every\r\nday, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able--but wait a moment,\r\nDr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment\r\nsomething moving upon that hillside?\"\r\n\r\nIt was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot\r\nagainst the dull green and gray.\r\n\r\n\"Come, sir, come!\" cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. \"You will see with\r\nyour own eyes and judge for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nThe telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon\r\nthe flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a\r\ncry of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Dr. Watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!\"\r\n\r\nThere he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his\r\nshoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. When he reached the crest I saw\r\nthe ragged uncouth figure outlined for an instant against the cold blue\r\nsky. He looked round him with a furtive and stealthy air, as one who\r\ndreads pursuit. Then he vanished over the hill.\r\n\r\n\"Well! Am I right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, there is a boy who seems to have some secret errand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what the errand is even a county constable could guess. But not\r\none word shall they have from me, and I bind you to secrecy also, Dr.\r\nWatson. Not a word! You understand!\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have treated me shamefully--shamefully. When the facts come out in\r\nFrankland v. Regina I venture to think that a thrill of indignation will\r\nrun through the country. Nothing would induce me to help the police in\r\nany way. For all they cared it might have been me, instead of my effigy,\r\nwhich these rascals burned at the stake. Surely you are not going! You\r\nwill help me to empty the decanter in honour of this great occasion!\"\r\n\r\nBut I resisted all his solicitations and succeeded in dissuading him\r\nfrom his announced intention of walking home with me. I kept the road\r\nas long as his eye was on me, and then I struck off across the moor and\r\nmade for the stony hill over which the boy had disappeared. Everything\r\nwas working in my favour, and I swore that it should not be through lack\r\nof energy or perseverance that I should miss the chance which fortune\r\nhad thrown in my way.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already sinking when I reached the summit of the hill, and\r\nthe long slopes beneath me were all golden-green on one side and gray\r\nshadow on the other. A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of\r\nwhich jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the\r\nwide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a\r\ngull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be\r\nthe only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert\r\nbeneath it. The barren scene, the sense of loneliness, and the mystery\r\nand urgency of my task all struck a chill into my heart. The boy was\r\nnowhere to be seen. But down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there\r\nwas a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there\r\nwas one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the\r\nweather. My heart leaped within me as I saw it. This must be the burrow\r\nwhere the stranger lurked. At last my foot was on the threshold of his\r\nhiding place--his secret was within my grasp.\r\n\r\nAs I approached the hut, walking as warily as Stapleton would do when\r\nwith poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, I satisfied myself\r\nthat the place had indeed been used as a habitation. A vague pathway\r\namong the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a\r\ndoor. All was silent within. The unknown might be lurking there, or\r\nhe might be prowling on the moor. My nerves tingled with the sense of\r\nadventure. Throwing aside my cigarette, I closed my hand upon the butt\r\nof my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, I looked in. The\r\nplace was empty.\r\n\r\nBut there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This\r\nwas certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof\r\nlay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once\r\nslumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it\r\nlay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of\r\nempty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I\r\nsaw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and\r\na half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of\r\nthe hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood\r\na small cloth bundle--the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the\r\ntelescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread,\r\na tinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down\r\nagain, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it\r\nthere lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this\r\nwas what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: \"Dr. Watson has gone to\r\nCoombe Tracey.\"\r\n\r\nFor a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the\r\nmeaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was\r\nbeing dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but\r\nhe had set an agent--the boy, perhaps--upon my track, and this was his\r\nreport. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor\r\nwhich had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling\r\nof an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\r\ndelicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment\r\nthat one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.\r\n\r\nIf there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut\r\nin search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind,\r\nnor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or\r\nintentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he\r\nmust be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.\r\nWhen I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I\r\nunderstood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept\r\nhim in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\r\nchance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until\r\nI knew.\r\n\r\nOutside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet\r\nand gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant\r\npools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers\r\nof Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the\r\nvillage of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house\r\nof the Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden\r\nevening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the\r\npeace of Nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that\r\ninterview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves\r\nbut a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with\r\nsombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot\r\nstriking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and\r\nnearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner and cocked the pistol in\r\nmy pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity\r\nof seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed\r\nthat he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a\r\nshadow fell across the opening of the hut.\r\n\r\n\"It is a lovely evening, my dear Watson,\" said a well-known voice. \"I\r\nreally think that you will be more comfortable outside than in.\"\r\n\nFor a moment or two I sat breathless, hardly able to believe my ears.\r\nThen my senses and my voice came back to me, while a crushing weight\r\nof responsibility seemed in an instant to be lifted from my soul. That\r\ncold, incisive, ironical voice could belong to but one man in all the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes!\" I cried--\"Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come out,\" said he, \"and please be careful with the revolver.\"\r\n\r\nI stooped under the rude lintel, and there he sat upon a stone outside,\r\nhis gray eyes dancing with amusement as they fell upon my astonished\r\nfeatures. He was thin and worn, but clear and alert, his keen face\r\nbronzed by the sun and roughened by the wind. In his tweed suit and\r\ncloth cap he looked like any other tourist upon the moor, and he had\r\ncontrived, with that catlike love of personal cleanliness which was one\r\nof his characteristics, that his chin should be as smooth and his linen\r\nas perfect as if he were in Baker Street.\r\n\r\n\"I never was more glad to see anyone in my life,\" said I as I wrung him\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\n\"Or more astonished, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must confess to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The surprise was not all on one side, I assure you. I had no idea that\r\nyou had found my occasional retreat, still less that you were inside it,\r\nuntil I was within twenty paces of the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"My footprint, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Watson, I fear that I could not undertake to recognize your\r\nfootprint amid all the footprints of the world. If you seriously desire\r\nto deceive me you must change your tobacconist; for when I see the stub\r\nof a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know that my friend\r\nWatson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there beside the path.\r\nYou threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged\r\ninto the empty hut.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity I was convinced\r\nthat you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the\r\ntenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the criminal?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps, on\r\nthe night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow the\r\nmoon to rise behind me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw you then.\"\r\n\r\n\"And have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to\r\nlook.\"\r\n\r\n\"The old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it out\r\nwhen first I saw the light flashing upon the lens.\" He rose and peeped\r\ninto the hut. \"Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some supplies.\r\nWhat's this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel\r\nlines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly\r\nfull knowledge of the case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\r\nresponsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\r\nnerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have\r\nyou been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that\r\ncase of blackmailing.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was what I wished you to think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you use me, and yet do not trust me!\" I cried with some\r\nbitterness. \"I think that I have deserved better at your hands, Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many other\r\ncases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play a\r\ntrick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did it,\r\nand it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me to\r\ncome down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir Henry\r\nand you it is confident that my point of view would have been the\r\nsame as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable\r\nopponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about\r\nas I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and\r\nI remain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my\r\nweight at a critical moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why keep me in the dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"For you to know could not have helped us and might possibly have led\r\nto my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your\r\nkindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an\r\nunnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me--you\r\nremember the little chap at the express office--and he has seen after\r\nmy simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want\r\nmore? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of\r\nfeet, and both have been invaluable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then my reports have all been wasted!\"--My voice trembled as I recalled\r\nthe pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\r\n\r\nHolmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Here are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure\r\nyou. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day\r\nupon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and\r\nthe intelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nI was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon\r\nme, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind. I\r\nfelt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was\r\nreally best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was\r\nupon the moor.\r\n\r\n\"That's better,\" said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. \"And\r\nnow tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons--it was not\r\ndifficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for\r\nI am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might\r\nbe of service to us in the matter. In fact, if you had not gone today it\r\nis exceedingly probable that I should have gone tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned\r\nchill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together\r\nin the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So\r\ninterested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\n\"This is most important,\" said he when I had concluded. \"It fills up a\r\ngap which I had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. You\r\nare aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and\r\nthe man Stapleton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know of a close intimacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt about the matter. They meet, they write, there\r\nis a complete understanding between them. Now, this puts a very powerful\r\nweapon into our hands. If I could only use it to detach his wife--\"\r\n\r\n\"His wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have\r\ngiven me. The lady who has passed here as Miss Stapleton is in reality\r\nhis wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens, Holmes! Are you sure of what you say? How could he have\r\npermitted Sir Henry to fall in love with her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Henry's falling in love could do no harm to anyone except Sir\r\nHenry. He took particular care that Sir Henry did not make love to her,\r\nas you have yourself observed. I repeat that the lady is his wife and\r\nnot his sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why this elaborate deception?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he foresaw that she would be very much more useful to him in\r\nthe character of a free woman.\"\r\n\r\nAll my unspoken instincts, my vague suspicions, suddenly took shape and\r\ncentred upon the naturalist. In that impassive colourless man, with his\r\nstraw hat and his butterfly-net, I seemed to see something terrible--a\r\ncreature of infinite patience and craft, with a smiling face and a\r\nmurderous heart.\r\n\r\n\"It is he, then, who is our enemy--it is he who dogged us in London?\"\r\n\r\n\"So I read the riddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the warning--it must have come from her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\nThe shape of some monstrous villainy, half seen, half guessed, loomed\r\nthrough the darkness which had girt me so long.\r\n\r\n\"But are you sure of this, Holmes? How do you know that the woman is his\r\nwife?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he so far forgot himself as to tell you a true piece of\r\nautobiography upon the occasion when he first met you, and I dare say\r\nhe has many a time regretted it since. He was once a schoolmaster in\r\nthe north of England. Now, there is no one more easy to trace than a\r\nschoolmaster. There are scholastic agencies by which one may identify\r\nany man who has been in the profession. A little investigation showed me\r\nthat a school had come to grief under atrocious circumstances, and that\r\nthe man who had owned it--the name was different--had disappeared with\r\nhis wife. The descriptions agreed. When I learned that the missing man\r\nwas devoted to entomology the identification was complete.\"\r\n\r\nThe darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.\r\n\r\n\"If this woman is in truth his wife, where does Mrs. Laura Lyons come\r\nin?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"That is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a\r\nlight. Your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very\r\nmuch. I did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her\r\nhusband. In that case, regarding Stapleton as an unmarried man, she\r\ncounted no doubt upon becoming his wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"And when she is undeceived?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then we may find the lady of service. It must be our first duty\r\nto see her--both of us--tomorrow. Don't you think, Watson, that you are\r\naway from your charge rather long? Your place should be at Baskerville\r\nHall.\"\r\n\r\nThe last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled\r\nupon the moor. A few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.\r\n\r\n\"One last question, Holmes,\" I said as I rose. \"Surely there is no need\r\nof secrecy between you and me. What is the meaning of it all? What is he\r\nafter?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes's voice sank as he answered:\r\n\r\n\"It is murder, Watson--refined, cold-blooded, deliberate murder. Do not\r\nask me for particulars. My nets are closing upon him, even as his are\r\nupon Sir Henry, and with your help he is already almost at my mercy.\r\nThere is but one danger which can threaten us. It is that he should\r\nstrike before we are ready to do so. Another day--two at the most--and\r\nI have my case complete, but until then guard your charge as closely\r\nas ever a fond mother watched her ailing child. Your mission today has\r\njustified itself, and yet I could almost wish that you had not left his\r\nside. Hark!\"\r\n\r\nA terrible scream--a prolonged yell of horror and anguish--burst out of\r\nthe silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice in\r\nmy veins.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my God!\" I gasped. \"What is it? What does it mean?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at\r\nthe door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,\r\nhis face peering into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" he whispered. \"Hush!\"\r\n\r\nThe cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out\r\nfrom somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,\r\nnearer, louder, more urgent than before.\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\" Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his voice\r\nthat he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. \"Where is it, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, I think.\" I pointed into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"No, there!\"\r\n\r\nAgain the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much\r\nnearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered\r\nrumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,\r\nconstant murmur of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"The hound!\" cried Holmes. \"Come, Watson, come! Great heavens, if we are\r\ntoo late!\"\r\n\r\nHe had started running swiftly over the moor, and I had followed at his\r\nheels. But now from somewhere among the broken ground immediately in\r\nfront of us there came one last despairing yell, and then a dull, heavy\r\nthud. We halted and listened. Not another sound broke the heavy silence\r\nof the windless night.\r\n\r\nI saw Holmes put his hand to his forehead like a man distracted. He\r\nstamped his feet upon the ground.\r\n\r\n\"He has beaten us, Watson. We are too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, surely not!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fool that I was to hold my hand. And you, Watson, see what comes of\r\nabandoning your charge! But, by Heaven, if the worst has happened we'll\r\navenge him!\"\r\n\r\nBlindly we ran through the gloom, blundering against boulders, forcing\r\nour way through gorse bushes, panting up hills and rushing down slopes,\r\nheading always in the direction whence those dreadful sounds had come.\r\nAt every rise Holmes looked eagerly round him, but the shadows were\r\nthick upon the moor, and nothing moved upon its dreary face.\r\n\r\n\"Can you see anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, hark, what is that?\"\r\n\r\nA low moan had fallen upon our ears. There it was again upon our left!\r\nOn that side a ridge of rocks ended in a sheer cliff which overlooked\r\na stone-strewn slope. On its jagged face was spread-eagled some dark,\r\nirregular object. As we ran towards it the vague outline hardened into\r\na definite shape. It was a prostrate man face downward upon the ground,\r\nthe head doubled under him at a horrible angle, the shoulders rounded\r\nand the body hunched together as if in the act of throwing a somersault.\r\nSo grotesque was the attitude that I could not for the instant realize\r\nthat that moan had been the passing of his soul. Not a whisper, not a\r\nrustle, rose now from the dark figure over which we stooped. Holmes laid\r\nhis hand upon him and held it up again with an exclamation of horror.\r\nThe gleam of the match which he struck shone upon his clotted fingers\r\nand upon the ghastly pool which widened slowly from the crushed skull\r\nof the victim. And it shone upon something else which turned our hearts\r\nsick and faint within us--the body of Sir Henry Baskerville!\r\n\r\nThere was no chance of either of us forgetting that peculiar ruddy tweed\r\nsuit--the very one which he had worn on the first morning that we had\r\nseen him in Baker Street. We caught the one clear glimpse of it, and\r\nthen the match flickered and went out, even as the hope had gone out\r\nof our souls. Holmes groaned, and his face glimmered white through the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\n\"The brute! The brute!\" I cried with clenched hands. \"Oh Holmes, I shall\r\nnever forgive myself for having left him to his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am more to blame than you, Watson. In order to have my case well\r\nrounded and complete, I have thrown away the life of my client. It is\r\nthe greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. But how could I\r\nknow--how could I know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor\r\nin the face of all my warnings?\"\r\n\r\n\"That we should have heard his screams--my God, those screams!--and yet\r\nhave been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which drove\r\nhim to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.\r\nAnd Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been murdered--the\r\none frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought\r\nto be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to\r\nescape from it. But now we have to prove the connection between the\r\nman and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the\r\nexistence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died from the\r\nfall. But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in my power\r\nbefore another day is past!\"\r\n\r\nWe stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\r\noverwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought\r\nall our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then as the moon\r\nrose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had\r\nfallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half\r\nsilver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen,\r\na single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the\r\nlonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at\r\nit as I gazed.\r\n\r\n\"Why should we not seize him at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last\r\ndegree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one\r\nfalse move the villain may escape us yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. Tonight we can only perform\r\nthe last offices to our poor friend.\"\r\n\r\nTogether we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the\r\nbody, black and clear against the silvered stones. The agony of those\r\ncontorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n\"We must send for help, Holmes! We cannot carry him all the way to the\r\nHall. Good heavens, are you mad?\"\r\n\r\nHe had uttered a cry and bent over the body. Now he was dancing and\r\nlaughing and wringing my hand. Could this be my stern, self-contained\r\nfriend? These were hidden fires, indeed!\r\n\r\n\"A beard! A beard! The man has a beard!\"\r\n\r\n\"A beard?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!\"\r\n\r\nWith feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard\r\nwas pointing up to the cold, clear moon. There could be no doubt about\r\nthe beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. It was indeed the same\r\nface which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the\r\nrock--the face of Selden, the criminal.\r\n\r\nThen in an instant it was all clear to me. I remembered how the baronet\r\nhad told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to Barrymore. Barrymore\r\nhad passed it on in order to help Selden in his escape. Boots, shirt,\r\ncap--it was all Sir Henry's. The tragedy was still black enough, but\r\nthis man had at least deserved death by the laws of his country. I told\r\nHolmes how the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness\r\nand joy.\r\n\r\n\"Then the clothes have been the poor devil's death,\" said he. \"It is\r\nclear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of\r\nSir Henry's--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\r\nprobability--and so ran this man down. There is one very singular thing,\r\nhowever: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on\r\nhis trail?\"\r\n\r\n\"He heard him.\"\r\n\r\n\"To hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this\r\nconvict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture\r\nby screaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way\r\nafter he knew the animal was on his track. How did he know?\"\r\n\r\n\"A greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our\r\nconjectures are correct--\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. I suppose that it\r\ndoes not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go\r\nunless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"My difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we\r\nshall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain\r\nforever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor\r\nwretch's body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate\r\nwith the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,\r\nWatson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful and\r\naudacious! Not a word to show your suspicions--not a word, or my plans\r\ncrumble to the ground.\"\r\n\r\nA figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow\r\nof a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper\r\nshape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and\r\nthen came on again.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last man that I\r\nshould have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,\r\ndear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not--don't tell me that it is our\r\nfriend Sir Henry!\" He hurried past me and stooped over the dead man. I\r\nheard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Who--who's this?\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"It is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.\"\r\n\r\nStapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had\r\novercome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from\r\nHolmes to me. \"Dear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?\"\r\n\r\n\"He appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My\r\nfriend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about\r\nSir Henry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why about Sir Henry in particular?\" I could not help asking.\r\n\r\n\"Because I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come\r\nI was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I\r\nheard cries upon the moor. By the way\"--his eyes darted again from my\r\nface to Holmes's--\"did you hear anything else besides a cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Holmes; \"did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom\r\nhound, and so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was\r\nwondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"We heard nothing of the kind,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"And what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.\r\nHe has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over\r\nhere and broken his neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"That seems the most reasonable theory,\" said Stapleton, and he gave a\r\nsigh which I took to indicate his relief. \"What do you think about it,\r\nMr. Sherlock Holmes?\"\r\n\r\nMy friend bowed his compliments. \"You are quick at identification,\" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n\"We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.\r\nYou are in time to see a tragedy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover\r\nthe facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you return tomorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my intention.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have\r\npuzzled us?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"One cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An investigator\r\nneeds facts and not legends or rumours. It has not been a satisfactory\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton\r\nstill looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\r\n\r\n\"I would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would\r\ngive my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it.\r\nI think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,\r\nHolmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to\r\nreturn alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the\r\nbroad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope\r\nwhich showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his\r\nend.\r\n\n\"We're at close grips at last,\" said Holmes as we walked together across\r\nthe moor. \"What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself together\r\nin the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he found that\r\nthe wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in London,\r\nWatson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a foeman more\r\nworthy of our steel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry that he has seen you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows\r\nyou are here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate\r\nmeasures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in\r\nhis own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we not arrest him at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is\r\nalways to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument's sake,\r\nthat we had him arrested tonight, what on earth the better off should\r\nwe be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There's the devilish\r\ncunning of it! If he were acting through a human agent we could get some\r\nevidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of day it\r\nwould not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its master.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely we have a case.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a shadow of one--only surmise and conjecture. We should be laughed\r\nout of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is Sir Charles's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Found dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of\r\nsheer fright, and we know also what frightened him, but how are we to\r\nget twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound?\r\nWhere are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does\r\nnot bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the\r\nbrute overtook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a\r\nposition to do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, tonight?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not much better off tonight. Again, there was no direct\r\nconnection between the hound and the man's death. We never saw the\r\nhound. We heard it, but we could not prove that it was running upon this\r\nman's trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;\r\nwe must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,\r\nand that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish\r\none.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you propose to do so?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the\r\nposition of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as\r\nwell. Sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before the\r\nday is past to have the upper hand at last.\"\r\n\r\nI could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,\r\nas far as the Baskerville gates.\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I see no reason for further concealment. But one last word,\r\nWatson. Say nothing of the hound to Sir Henry. Let him think that\r\nSelden's death was as Stapleton would have us believe. He will have a\r\nbetter nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow,\r\nwhen he is engaged, if I remember your report aright, to dine with these\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so am I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. That will be easily\r\narranged. And now, if we are too late for dinner, I think that we are\r\nboth ready for our suppers.\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry was more pleased than surprised to see Sherlock Holmes, for he\r\nhad for some days been expecting that recent events would bring him down\r\nfrom London. He did raise his eyebrows, however, when he found that my\r\nfriend had neither any luggage nor any explanations for its absence.\r\nBetween us we soon supplied his wants, and then over a belated supper\r\nwe explained to the baronet as much of our experience as it seemed\r\ndesirable that he should know. But first I had the unpleasant duty of\r\nbreaking the news to Barrymore and his wife. To him it may have been an\r\nunmitigated relief, but she wept bitterly in her apron. To all the world\r\nhe was the man of violence, half animal and half demon; but to her he\r\nalways remained the little wilful boy of her own girlhood, the child who\r\nhad clung to her hand. Evil indeed is the man who has not one woman to\r\nmourn him.\r\n\r\n\"I've been moping in the house all day since Watson went off in the\r\nmorning,\" said the baronet. \"I guess I should have some credit, for I\r\nhave kept my promise. If I hadn't sworn not to go about alone I might\r\nhave had a more lively evening, for I had a message from Stapleton\r\nasking me over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,\" said\r\nHolmes drily. \"By the way, I don't suppose you appreciate that we have\r\nbeen mourning over you as having broken your neck?\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry opened his eyes. \"How was that?\"\r\n\r\n\"This poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. I fear your servant who\r\ngave them to him may get into trouble with the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is unlikely. There was no mark on any of them, as far as I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's lucky for him--in fact, it's lucky for all of you, since you are\r\nall on the wrong side of the law in this matter. I am not sure that as\r\na conscientious detective my first duty is not to arrest the whole\r\nhousehold. Watson's reports are most incriminating documents.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how about the case?\" asked the baronet. \"Have you made anything out\r\nof the tangle? I don't know that Watson and I are much the wiser since\r\nwe came down.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I shall be in a position to make the situation rather more\r\nclear to you before long. It has been an exceedingly difficult and most\r\ncomplicated business. There are several points upon which we still want\r\nlight--but it is coming all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've had one experience, as Watson has no doubt told you. We heard the\r\nhound on the moor, so I can swear that it is not all empty superstition.\r\nI had something to do with dogs when I was out West, and I know one when\r\nI hear one. If you can muzzle that one and put him on a chain I'll be\r\nready to swear you are the greatest detective of all time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I will muzzle him and chain him all right if you will give me\r\nyour help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever you tell me to do I will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good; and I will ask you also to do it blindly, without always\r\nasking the reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will do this I think the chances are that our little problem\r\nwill soon be solved. I have no doubt--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly and stared fixedly up over my head into the air. The\r\nlamp beat upon his face, and so intent was it and so still that it might\r\nhave been that of a clear-cut classical statue, a personification of\r\nalertness and expectation.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" we both cried.\r\n\r\nI could see as he looked down that he was repressing some internal\r\nemotion. His features were still composed, but his eyes shone with\r\namused exultation.\r\n\r\n\"Excuse the admiration of a connoisseur,\" said he as he waved his hand\r\ntowards the line of portraits which covered the opposite wall. \"Watson\r\nwon't allow that I know anything of art but that is mere jealousy\r\nbecause our views upon the subject differ. Now, these are a really very\r\nfine series of portraits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so,\" said Sir Henry, glancing with some\r\nsurprise at my friend. \"I don't pretend to know much about these things,\r\nand I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I\r\ndidn't know that you found time for such things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's a Kneller,\r\nI'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the stout\r\ngentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family\r\nportraits, I presume?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the names?\"\r\n\r\n\"Barrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\r\nlessons fairly well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is the gentleman with the telescope?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West\r\nIndies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William\r\nBaskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons\r\nunder Pitt.\"\r\n\r\n\"And this Cavalier opposite to me--the one with the black velvet and the\r\nlace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the\r\nmischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.\r\nWe're not likely to forget him.\"\r\n\r\nI gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said Holmes, \"he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough, but\r\nI dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had pictured\r\nhim as a more robust and ruffianly person.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,\r\n1647, are on the back of the canvas.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to\r\nhave a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it\r\nduring supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his\r\nroom, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me\r\nback into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he\r\nheld it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see anything there?\"\r\n\r\nI looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace\r\ncollar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It\r\nwas not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a\r\nfirm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.\r\n\r\n\"Is it like anyone you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant!\" He stood upon a\r\nchair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right\r\narm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" I cried in amazement.\r\n\r\nThe face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, you see it now. My eyes have been trained to examine faces and not\r\ntheir trimmings. It is the first quality of a criminal investigator that\r\nhe should see through a disguise.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is marvellous. It might be his portrait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is an interesting instance of a throwback, which appears to be\r\nboth physical and spiritual. A study of family portraits is enough\r\nto convert a man to the doctrine of reincarnation. The fellow is a\r\nBaskerville--that is evident.\"\r\n\r\n\"With designs upon the succession.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. This chance of the picture has supplied us with one of our\r\nmost obvious missing links. We have him, Watson, we have him, and I dare\r\nswear that before tomorrow night he will be fluttering in our net as\r\nhelpless as one of his own butterflies. A pin, a cork, and a card, and\r\nwe add him to the Baker Street collection!\" He burst into one of his\r\nrare fits of laughter as he turned away from the picture. I have not\r\nheard him laugh often, and it has always boded ill to somebody.\r\n\r\nI was up betimes in the morning, but Holmes was afoot earlier still, for\r\nI saw him as I dressed, coming up the drive.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we should have a full day today,\" he remarked, and he rubbed his\r\nhands with the joy of action. \"The nets are all in place, and the drag\r\nis about to begin. We'll know before the day is out whether we have\r\ncaught our big, leanjawed pike, or whether he has got through the\r\nmeshes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been on the moor already?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have sent a report from Grimpen to Princetown as to the death of\r\nSelden. I think I can promise that none of you will be troubled in the\r\nmatter. And I have also communicated with my faithful Cartwright, who\r\nwould certainly have pined away at the door of my hut, as a dog does at\r\nhis master's grave, if I had not set his mind at rest about my safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the next move?\"\r\n\r\n\"To see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, Holmes,\" said the baronet. \"You look like a general who\r\nis planning a battle with his chief of the staff.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends\r\nthe Stapletons tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I\r\nam sure that they would be very glad to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear that Watson and I must go to London.\"\r\n\r\n\"To London?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\r\njuncture.\"\r\n\r\nThe baronet's face perceptibly lengthened.\r\n\r\n\"I hoped that you were going to see me through this business. The Hall\r\nand the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I tell\r\nyou. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to have\r\ncome with you, but that urgent business required us to be in town. We\r\nhope very soon to return to Devonshire. Will you remember to give them\r\nthat message?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you insist upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no alternative, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\nI saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he\r\nregarded as our desertion.\r\n\r\n\"When do you desire to go?\" he asked coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but\r\nWatson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.\r\nWatson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret\r\nthat you cannot come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a good mind to go to London with you,\" said the baronet. \"Why\r\nshould I stay here alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that you\r\nwould do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, then, I'll stay.\"\r\n\r\n\"One more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back\r\nyour trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.\"\r\n\r\n\"To walk across the moor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in\r\nyour nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that\r\nyou should do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction\r\nsave along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the\r\nGrimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do just what you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as\r\npossible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.\"\r\n\r\nI was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes\r\nhad said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate\r\nnext day. It had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to\r\ngo with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a\r\nmoment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for\r\nit, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful\r\nfriend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of\r\nCoombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A\r\nsmall boy was waiting upon the platform.\r\n\r\n\"Any orders, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive you\r\nwill send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that if he\r\nfinds the pocketbook which I have dropped he is to send it by registered\r\npost to Baker Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ask at the station office if there is a message for me.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy returned with a telegram, which Holmes handed to me. It ran:\r\n\r\nWire received. Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive five-forty.\r\nLestrade.\r\n\r\n\"That is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\r\nprofessionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I\r\nthink that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your\r\nacquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\"\r\n\r\nHis plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the\r\nbaronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,\r\nwhile we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to\r\nbe needed. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the\r\nStapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I\r\nseemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.\r\n\r\nMrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his\r\ninterview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.\r\n\r\n\"I am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the\r\nlate Sir Charles Baskerville,\" said he. \"My friend here, Dr. Watson,\r\nhas informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have\r\nwithheld in connection with that matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What have I withheld?\" she asked defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"You have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten\r\no'clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You have\r\nwithheld what the connection is between these events.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But\r\nI think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection, after all. I\r\nwish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as\r\none of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.\r\nStapleton but his wife as well.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady sprang from her chair.\r\n\r\n\"His wife!\" she cried.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his\r\nsister is really his wife.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her\r\nchair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure\r\nof her grip.\r\n\r\n\"His wife!\" she said again. \"His wife! He is not a married man.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"Prove it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so--!\"\r\n\r\nThe fierce flash of her eyes said more than any words.\r\n\r\n\"I have come prepared to do so,\" said Holmes, drawing several papers\r\nfrom his pocket. \"Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four\r\nyears ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have no\r\ndifficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by sight.\r\nHere are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of Mr. and\r\nMrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private school. Read\r\nthem and see if you can doubt the identity of these people.\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at them, and then looked up at us with the set, rigid face\r\nof a desperate woman.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" she said, \"this man had offered me marriage on condition\r\nthat I could get a divorce from my husband. He has lied to me, the\r\nvillain, in every conceivable way. Not one word of truth has he ever\r\ntold me. And why--why? I imagined that all was for my own sake. But now\r\nI see that I was never anything but a tool in his hands. Why should I\r\npreserve faith with him who never kept any with me? Why should I try to\r\nshield him from the consequences of his own wicked acts? Ask me what you\r\nlike, and there is nothing which I shall hold back. One thing I swear\r\nto you, and that is that when I wrote the letter I never dreamed of any\r\nharm to the old gentleman, who had been my kindest friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I entirely believe you, madam,\" said Sherlock Holmes. \"The recital of\r\nthese events must be very painful to you, and perhaps it will make it\r\neasier if I tell you what occurred, and you can check me if I make any\r\nmaterial mistake. The sending of this letter was suggested to you by\r\nStapleton?\"\r\n\r\n\"He dictated it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume that the reason he gave was that you would receive help from\r\nSir Charles for the legal expenses connected with your divorce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And then after you had sent the letter he dissuaded you from keeping\r\nthe appointment?\"\r\n\r\n\"He told me that it would hurt his self-respect that any other man\r\nshould find the money for such an object, and that though he was a poor\r\nman himself he would devote his last penny to removing the obstacles\r\nwhich divided us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He appears to be a very consistent character. And then you heard\r\nnothing until you read the reports of the death in the paper?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"And he made you swear to say nothing about your appointment with Sir\r\nCharles?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did. He said that the death was a very mysterious one, and that I\r\nshould certainly be suspected if the facts came out. He frightened me\r\ninto remaining silent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. But you had your suspicions?\"\r\n\r\nShe hesitated and looked down.\r\n\r\n\"I knew him,\" she said. \"But if he had kept faith with me I should\r\nalways have done so with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that on the whole you have had a fortunate escape,\" said\r\nSherlock Holmes. \"You have had him in your power and he knew it, and yet\r\nyou are alive. You have been walking for some months very near to the\r\nedge of a precipice. We must wish you good-morning now, Mrs. Lyons, and\r\nit is probable that you will very shortly hear from us again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our case becomes rounded off, and difficulty after difficulty thins\r\naway in front of us,\" said Holmes as we stood waiting for the arrival of\r\nthe express from town. \"I shall soon be in the position of being able\r\nto put into a single connected narrative one of the most singular\r\nand sensational crimes of modern times. Students of criminology will\r\nremember the analogous incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year\r\n'66, and of course there are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but\r\nthis case possesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now\r\nwe have no clear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very\r\nmuch surprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this\r\nnight.\"\r\n\r\nThe London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry\r\nbulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three\r\nshook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which\r\nLestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since\r\nthe days when they had first worked together. I could well remember\r\nthe scorn which the theories of the reasoner used then to excite in the\r\npractical man.\r\n\r\n\"Anything good?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"The biggest thing for years,\" said Holmes. \"We have two hours before\r\nwe need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some\r\ndinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your\r\nthroat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never\r\nbeen there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first visit.\"\r\n\nOne of Sherlock Holmes's defects--if, indeed, one may call it a\r\ndefect--was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans\r\nto any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it\r\ncame no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and\r\nsurprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional\r\ncaution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however,\r\nwas very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants.\r\nI had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long\r\ndrive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we\r\nwere about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\r\nand I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves\r\nthrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and\r\nthe dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we\r\nwere back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every\r\nturn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.\r\n\r\nOur conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired\r\nwagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our\r\nnerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,\r\nafter that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's\r\nhouse and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene\r\nof action. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of\r\nthe avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe\r\nTracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.\r\n\r\n\"Are you armed, Lestrade?\"\r\n\r\nThe little detective smiled. \"As long as I have my trousers I have a\r\nhip-pocket, and as long as I have my hip-pocket I have something in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's the game\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"A waiting game.\"\r\n\r\n\"My word, it does not seem a very cheerful place,\" said the detective\r\nwith a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and\r\nat the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. \"I see the\r\nlights of a house ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you\r\nto walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.\"\r\n\r\nWe moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,\r\nbut Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.\r\n\r\n\"This will do,\" said he. \"These rocks upon the right make an admirable\r\nscreen.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are to wait here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\r\nLestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you\r\ntell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this\r\nend?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think they are the kitchen windows.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the one beyond, which shines so brightly?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is certainly the dining-room.\"\r\n\r\n\"The blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward\r\nquietly and see what they are doing--but for heaven's sake don't let\r\nthem know that they are watched!\"\r\n\r\nI tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded\r\nthe stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I\r\ncould look straight through the uncurtained window.\r\n\r\nThere were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat\r\nwith their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both\r\nof them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.\r\nStapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and\r\ndistrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened\r\nmoor was weighing heavily upon his mind.\r\n\r\nAs I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry\r\nfilled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his\r\ncigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon\r\ngravel. The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall\r\nunder which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the\r\ndoor of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in\r\na lock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from\r\nwithin. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn\r\nonce more and he passed me and reentered the house. I saw him rejoin his\r\nguest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting to\r\ntell them what I had seen.\r\n\r\n\"You say, Watson, that the lady is not there?\" Holmes asked when I had\r\nfinished my report.\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can she be, then, since there is no light in any other room\r\nexcept the kitchen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think where she is.\"\r\n\r\nI have said that over the great Grimpen Mire there hung a dense, white\r\nfog. It was drifting slowly in our direction and banked itself up like a\r\nwall on that side of us, low but thick and well defined. The moon shone\r\non it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the heads\r\nof the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes's face\r\nwas turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched its\r\nsluggish drift.\r\n\r\n\"It's moving towards us, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that serious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very serious, indeed--the one thing upon earth which could have\r\ndisarranged my plans. He can't be very long, now. It is already ten\r\no'clock. Our success and even his life may depend upon his coming out\r\nbefore the fog is over the path.\"\r\n\r\nThe night was clear and fine above us. The stars shone cold and bright,\r\nwhile a half-moon bathed the whole scene in a soft, uncertain light.\r\nBefore us lay the dark bulk of the house, its serrated roof and\r\nbristling chimneys hard outlined against the silver-spangled sky. Broad\r\nbars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard\r\nand the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left\r\nthe kitchen. There only remained the lamp in the dining-room where the\r\ntwo men, the murderous host and the unconscious guest, still chatted\r\nover their cigars.\r\n\r\nEvery minute that white woolly plain which covered one-half of the moor\r\nwas drifting closer and closer to the house. Already the first thin\r\nwisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window.\r\nThe farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees\r\nwere standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the\r\nfog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled\r\nslowly into one dense bank on which the upper floor and the roof\r\nfloated like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand\r\npassionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n\"If he isn't out in a quarter of an hour the path will be covered. In\r\nhalf an hour we won't be able to see our hands in front of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we move farther back upon higher ground?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think it would be as well.\"\r\n\r\nSo as the fog-bank flowed onward we fell back before it until we were\r\nhalf a mile from the house, and still that dense white sea, with the\r\nmoon silvering its upper edge, swept slowly and inexorably on.\r\n\r\n\"We are going too far,\" said Holmes. \"We dare not take the chance of his\r\nbeing overtaken before he can reach us. At all costs we must hold our\r\nground where we are.\" He dropped on his knees and clapped his ear to the\r\nground. \"Thank God, I think that I hear him coming.\"\r\n\r\nA sound of quick steps broke the silence of the moor. Crouching among\r\nthe stones we stared intently at the silver-tipped bank in front of us.\r\nThe steps grew louder, and through the fog, as through a curtain, there\r\nstepped the man whom we were awaiting. He looked round him in surprise\r\nas he emerged into the clear, starlit night. Then he came swiftly along\r\nthe path, passed close to where we lay, and went on up the long slope\r\nbehind us. As he walked he glanced continually over either shoulder,\r\nlike a man who is ill at ease.\r\n\r\n\"Hist!\" cried Holmes, and I heard the sharp click of a cocking pistol.\r\n\"Look out! It's coming!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a thin, crisp, continuous patter from somewhere in the heart\r\nof that crawling bank. The cloud was within fifty yards of where we lay,\r\nand we glared at it, all three, uncertain what horror was about to break\r\nfrom the heart of it. I was at Holmes's elbow, and I glanced for an\r\ninstant at his face. It was pale and exultant, his eyes shining brightly\r\nin the moonlight. But suddenly they started forward in a rigid, fixed\r\nstare, and his lips parted in amazement. At the same instant Lestrade\r\ngave a yell of terror and threw himself face downward upon the ground.\r\nI sprang to my feet, my inert hand grasping my pistol, my mind paralyzed\r\nby the dreadful shape which had sprung out upon us from the shadows of\r\nthe fog. A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a\r\nhound as mortal eyes have ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its\r\neyes glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap\r\nwere outlined in flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of\r\na disordered brain could anything more savage, more appalling, more\r\nhellish be conceived than that dark form and savage face which broke\r\nupon us out of the wall of fog.\r\n\r\nWith long bounds the huge black creature was leaping down the track,\r\nfollowing hard upon the footsteps of our friend. So paralyzed were we by\r\nthe apparition that we allowed him to pass before we had recovered our\r\nnerve. Then Holmes and I both fired together, and the creature gave a\r\nhideous howl, which showed that one at least had hit him. He did not\r\npause, however, but bounded onward. Far away on the path we saw Sir\r\nHenry looking back, his face white in the moonlight, his hands raised in\r\nhorror, glaring helplessly at the frightful thing which was hunting him\r\ndown. But that cry of pain from the hound had blown all our fears to the\r\nwinds. If he was vulnerable he was mortal, and if we could wound him we\r\ncould kill him. Never have I seen a man run as Holmes ran that night. I\r\nam reckoned fleet of foot, but he outpaced me as much as I outpaced the\r\nlittle professional. In front of us as we flew up the track we heard\r\nscream after scream from Sir Henry and the deep roar of the hound. I was\r\nin time to see the beast spring upon its victim, hurl him to the ground,\r\nand worry at his throat. But the next instant Holmes had emptied five\r\nbarrels of his revolver into the creature's flank. With a last howl of\r\nagony and a vicious snap in the air, it rolled upon its back, four feet\r\npawing furiously, and then fell limp upon its side. I stooped, panting,\r\nand pressed my pistol to the dreadful, shimmering head, but it was\r\nuseless to press the trigger. The giant hound was dead.\r\n\r\nSir Henry lay insensible where he had fallen. We tore away his collar,\r\nand Holmes breathed a prayer of gratitude when we saw that there was\r\nno sign of a wound and that the rescue had been in time. Already our\r\nfriend's eyelids shivered and he made a feeble effort to move. Lestrade\r\nthrust his brandy-flask between the baronet's teeth, and two frightened\r\neyes were looking up at us.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" he whispered. \"What was it? What, in heaven's name, was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's dead, whatever it is,\" said Holmes. \"We've laid the family ghost\r\nonce and forever.\"\r\n\r\nIn mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying\r\nstretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure\r\nmastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two--gaunt, savage,\r\nand as large as a small lioness. Even now in the stillness of death,\r\nthe huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small,\r\ndeep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the\r\nglowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and\r\ngleamed in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Phosphorus,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"A cunning preparation of it,\" said Holmes, sniffing at the dead animal.\r\n\"There is no smell which might have interfered with his power of scent.\r\nWe owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you to this\r\nfright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature as this.\r\nAnd the fog gave us little time to receive him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have saved my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Having first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\r\nanything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures tonight. If\r\nyou will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and\r\ntrembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering\r\nwith his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\n\"We must leave you now,\" said Holmes. \"The rest of our work must be\r\ndone, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we\r\nonly want our man.\r\n\r\n\"It's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house,\" he\r\ncontinued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. \"Those shots\r\nmust have told him that the game was up.\"\r\n\r\n\"We were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.\"\r\n\r\n\"He followed the hound to call him off--of that you may be certain. No,\r\nno, he's gone by this time! But we'll search the house and make sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to\r\nroom to the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the\r\npassage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught\r\nup the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we\r\nsee of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of\r\nthe bedroom doors was locked.\r\n\r\n\"There's someone in here,\" cried Lestrade. \"I can hear a movement. Open\r\nthis door!\"\r\n\r\nA faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door\r\njust over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in\r\nhand, we all three rushed into the room.\r\n\r\nBut there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain\r\nwhom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange\r\nand so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.\r\n\r\nThe room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were\r\nlined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of\r\nbutterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of\r\nthis complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an\r\nupright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the\r\nold worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a\r\nfigure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been\r\nused to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it\r\nwas that of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was\r\nsecured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of\r\nthe face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full of grief and shame and a\r\ndreadful questioning--stared back at us. In a minute we had torn off\r\nthe gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in\r\nfront of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear\r\nred weal of a whiplash across her neck.\r\n\r\n\"The brute!\" cried Holmes. \"Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put her\r\nin the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes again.\r\n\r\n\"Is he safe?\" she asked. \"Has he escaped?\"\r\n\r\n\"He cannot escape us, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the hound?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is dead.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!\"\r\nShe shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they\r\nwere all mottled with bruises. \"But this is nothing--nothing! It is my\r\nmind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,\r\nill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could\r\nstill cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in\r\nthis also I have been his dupe and his tool.\" She broke into passionate\r\nsobbing as she spoke.\r\n\r\n\"You bear him no good will, madam,\" said Holmes. \"Tell us then where we\r\nshall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and so\r\natone.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one place where he can have fled,\" she answered. \"There is\r\nan old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there that\r\nhe kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that he\r\nmight have a refuge. That is where he would fly.\"\r\n\r\nThe fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the\r\nlamp towards it.\r\n\r\n\"See,\" said he. \"No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\r\ntonight.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with\r\nfierce merriment.\r\n\r\n\"He may find his way in, but never out,\" she cried. \"How can he see the\r\nguiding wands tonight? We planted them together, he and I, to mark the\r\npathway through the mire. Oh, if I could only have plucked them out\r\ntoday. Then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!\"\r\n\r\nIt was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had\r\nlifted. Meanwhile we left Lestrade in possession of the house while\r\nHolmes and I went back with the baronet to Baskerville Hall. The story\r\nof the Stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took\r\nthe blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had\r\nloved. But the shock of the night's adventures had shattered his nerves,\r\nand before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of\r\nDr. Mortimer. The two of them were destined to travel together round the\r\nworld before Sir Henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he\r\nhad been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.\r\n\r\nAnd now I come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in\r\nwhich I have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague\r\nsurmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a\r\nmanner. On the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted\r\nand we were guided by Mrs. Stapleton to the point where they had found\r\na pathway through the bog. It helped us to realize the horror of this\r\nwoman's life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us\r\non her husband's track. We left her standing upon the thin peninsula of\r\nfirm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. From the\r\nend of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path\r\nzigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits\r\nand foul quagmires which barred the way to the stranger. Rank reeds and\r\nlush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay and a heavy miasmatic\r\nvapour onto our faces, while a false step plunged us more than once\r\nthigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft\r\nundulations around our feet. Its tenacious grip plucked at our heels as\r\nwe walked, and when we sank into it it was as if some malignant hand was\r\ntugging us down into those obscene depths, so grim and purposeful was\r\nthe clutch in which it held us. Once only we saw a trace that someone\r\nhad passed that perilous way before us. From amid a tuft of cotton grass\r\nwhich bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. Holmes\r\nsank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we\r\nnot been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot\r\nupon firm land again. He held an old black boot in the air. \"Meyers,\r\nToronto,\" was printed on the leather inside.\r\n\r\n\"It is worth a mud bath,\" said he. \"It is our friend Sir Henry's missing\r\nboot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thrown there by Stapleton in his flight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. He retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound\r\nupon the track. He fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching\r\nit. And he hurled it away at this point of his flight. We know at least\r\nthat he came so far in safety.\"\r\n\r\nBut more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much\r\nwhich we might surmise. There was no chance of finding footsteps in the\r\nmire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last\r\nreached firmer ground beyond the morass we all looked eagerly for them.\r\nBut no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. If the earth told a\r\ntrue story, then Stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards\r\nwhich he struggled through the fog upon that last night. Somewhere in\r\nthe heart of the great Grimpen Mire, down in the foul slime of the\r\nhuge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is\r\nforever buried.\r\n\r\nMany traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his\r\nsavage ally. A huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish\r\nshowed the position of an abandoned mine. Beside it were the crumbling\r\nremains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul\r\nreek of the surrounding swamp. In one of these a staple and chain with\r\na quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.\r\nA skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the\r\ndebris.\r\n\r\n\"A dog!\" said Holmes. \"By Jove, a curly-haired spaniel. Poor Mortimer\r\nwill never see his pet again. Well, I do not know that this place\r\ncontains any secret which we have not already fathomed. He could hide\r\nhis hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries\r\nwhich even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. On an emergency he\r\ncould keep the hound in the out-house at Merripit, but it was always a\r\nrisk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end\r\nof all his efforts, that he dared do it. This paste in the tin is no\r\ndoubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. It was\r\nsuggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the\r\ndesire to frighten old Sir Charles to death. No wonder the poor devil of\r\na convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves\r\nmight have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the\r\ndarkness of the moor upon his track. It was a cunning device, for, apart\r\nfrom the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would\r\nventure to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight\r\nof it, as many have done, upon the moor? I said it in London, Watson,\r\nand I say it again now, that never yet have we helped to hunt down a\r\nmore dangerous man than he who is lying yonder\"--he swept his long arm\r\ntowards the huge mottled expanse of green-splotched bog which stretched\r\naway until it merged into the russet slopes of the moor.\r\n\nIt was the end of November, and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy\r\nnight, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker\r\nStreet. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been\r\nengaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which\r\nhe had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection\r\nwith the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second\r\nhe had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge\r\nof murder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\r\nstep-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be\r\nremembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York.\r\nMy friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended\r\na succession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to\r\ninduce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had\r\nwaited patiently for the opportunity for I was aware that he would never\r\npermit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not\r\nbe drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. Sir\r\nHenry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to that\r\nlong voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\r\nshattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that\r\nit was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.\r\n\r\n\"The whole course of events,\" said Holmes, \"from the point of view of\r\nthe man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although\r\nto us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of\r\nhis actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared\r\nexceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with\r\nMrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I\r\nam not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.\r\nYou will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading B in my\r\nindexed list of cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you would kindly give me a sketch of the course of events from\r\nmemory.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, though I cannot guarantee that I carry all the facts in my\r\nmind. Intense mental concentration has a curious way of blotting out\r\nwhat has passed. The barrister who has his case at his fingers' ends and\r\nis able to argue with an expert upon his own subject finds that a week\r\nor two of the courts will drive it all out of his head once more. So\r\neach of my cases displaces the last, and Mlle. Carere has blurred my\r\nrecollection of Baskerville Hall. Tomorrow some other little problem may\r\nbe submitted to my notice which will in turn dispossess the fair French\r\nlady and the infamous Upwood. So far as the case of the hound goes,\r\nhowever, I will give you the course of events as nearly as I can, and\r\nyou will suggest anything which I may have forgotten.\r\n\r\n\"My inquiries show beyond all question that the family portrait did not\r\nlie, and that this fellow was indeed a Baskerville. He was a son of that\r\nRodger Baskerville, the younger brother of Sir Charles, who fled with\r\na sinister reputation to South America, where he was said to have died\r\nunmarried. He did, as a matter of fact, marry, and had one child, this\r\nfellow, whose real name is the same as his father's. He married Beryl\r\nGarcia, one of the beauties of Costa Rica, and, having purloined a\r\nconsiderable sum of public money, he changed his name to Vandeleur and\r\nfled to England, where he established a school in the east of Yorkshire.\r\nHis reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had\r\nstruck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage\r\nhome, and that he had used this man's ability to make the undertaking a\r\nsuccess. Fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun\r\nwell sank from disrepute into infamy. The Vandeleurs found it convenient\r\nto change their name to Stapleton, and he brought the remains of his\r\nfortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to\r\nthe south of England. I learned at the British Museum that he was a\r\nrecognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of Vandeleur\r\nhas been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his\r\nYorkshire days, been the first to describe.\r\n\r\n\"We now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such\r\nintense interest to us. The fellow had evidently made inquiry and found\r\nthat only two lives intervened between him and a valuable estate. When\r\nhe went to Devonshire his plans were, I believe, exceedingly hazy, but\r\nthat he meant mischief from the first is evident from the way in which\r\nhe took his wife with him in the character of his sister. The idea of\r\nusing her as a decoy was clearly already in his mind, though he may not\r\nhave been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. He\r\nmeant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool\r\nor run any risk for that end. His first act was to establish himself as\r\nnear to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate\r\na friendship with Sir Charles Baskerville and with the neighbours.\r\n\r\n\"The baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared\r\nthe way for his own death. Stapleton, as I will continue to call him,\r\nknew that the old man's heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.\r\nSo much he had learned from Dr. Mortimer. He had heard also that Sir\r\nCharles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.\r\nHis ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could\r\nbe done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the\r\nguilt to the real murderer.\r\n\r\n\"Having conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with\r\nconsiderable finesse. An ordinary schemer would have been content\r\nto work with a savage hound. The use of artificial means to make the\r\ncreature diabolical was a flash of genius upon his part. The dog he\r\nbought in London from Ross and Mangles, the dealers in Fulham Road. It\r\nwas the strongest and most savage in their possession. He brought it\r\ndown by the North Devon line and walked a great distance over the moor\r\nso as to get it home without exciting any remarks. He had already on his\r\ninsect hunts learned to penetrate the Grimpen Mire, and so had found a\r\nsafe hiding-place for the creature. Here he kennelled it and waited his\r\nchance.\r\n\r\n\"But it was some time coming. The old gentleman could not be decoyed\r\noutside of his grounds at night. Several times Stapleton lurked about\r\nwith his hound, but without avail. It was during these fruitless quests\r\nthat he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend\r\nof the demon dog received a new confirmation. He had hoped that his wife\r\nmight lure Sir Charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly\r\nindependent. She would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in\r\na sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.\r\nThreats and even, I am sorry to say, blows refused to move her. She\r\nwould have nothing to do with it, and for a time Stapleton was at a\r\ndeadlock.\r\n\r\n\"He found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that Sir\r\nCharles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister\r\nof his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\r\nBy representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence\r\nover her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her\r\nobtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. His plans were\r\nsuddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that Sir Charles was about\r\nto leave the Hall on the advice of Dr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he\r\nhimself pretended to coincide. He must act at once, or his victim might\r\nget beyond his power. He therefore put pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to\r\nwrite this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on\r\nthe evening before his departure for London. He then, by a specious\r\nargument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he\r\nhad waited.\r\n\r\n\"Driving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get\r\nhis hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast\r\nround to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find\r\nthe old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over\r\nthe wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming\r\ndown the yew alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a\r\ndreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws\r\nand blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end\r\nof the alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the\r\ngrassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track\r\nbut the man's was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\r\nprobably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned\r\naway again. It was then that it left the print which was actually\r\nobserved by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away to\r\nits lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled\r\nthe authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case\r\nwithin the scope of our observation.\r\n\r\n\"So much for the death of Sir Charles Baskerville. You perceive the\r\ndevilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make\r\na case against the real murderer. His only accomplice was one who could\r\nnever give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of\r\nthe device only served to make it more effective. Both of the women\r\nconcerned in the case, Mrs. Stapleton and Mrs. Laura Lyons, were left\r\nwith a strong suspicion against Stapleton. Mrs. Stapleton knew that he\r\nhad designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.\r\nMrs. Lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the\r\ndeath occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only\r\nknown to him. However, both of them were under his influence, and he had\r\nnothing to fear from them. The first half of his task was successfully\r\naccomplished but the more difficult still remained.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible that Stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir\r\nin Canada. In any case he would very soon learn it from his friend Dr.\r\nMortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of\r\nHenry Baskerville. Stapleton's first idea was that this young stranger\r\nfrom Canada might possibly be done to death in London without coming\r\ndown to Devonshire at all. He distrusted his wife ever since she had\r\nrefused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not\r\nleave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence\r\nover her. It was for this reason that he took her to London with him.\r\nThey lodged, I find, at the Mexborough Private Hotel, in Craven Street,\r\nwhich was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search\r\nof evidence. Here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while\r\nhe, disguised in a beard, followed Dr. Mortimer to Baker Street and\r\nafterwards to the station and to the Northumberland Hotel. His wife had\r\nsome inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband--a\r\nfear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write to warn\r\nthe man whom she knew to be in danger. If the letter should fall into\r\nStapleton's hands her own life would not be safe. Eventually, as we\r\nknow, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would\r\nform the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. It\r\nreached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.\r\n\r\n\"It was very essential for Stapleton to get some article of Sir Henry's\r\nattire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always\r\nhave the means of setting him upon his track. With characteristic\r\npromptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt\r\nthat the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him\r\nin his design. By chance, however, the first boot which was procured for\r\nhim was a new one and, therefore, useless for his purpose. He then had\r\nit returned and obtained another--a most instructive incident, since it\r\nproved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,\r\nas no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old\r\nboot and this indifference to a new one. The more outre and grotesque an\r\nincident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very\r\npoint which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and\r\nscientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.\r\n\r\n\"Then we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always\r\nby Stapleton in the cab. From his knowledge of our rooms and of my\r\nappearance, as well as from his general conduct, I am inclined to think\r\nthat Stapleton's career of crime has been by no means limited to this\r\nsingle Baskerville affair. It is suggestive that during the last three\r\nyears there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country,\r\nfor none of which was any criminal ever arrested. The last of these, at\r\nFolkestone Court, in May, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling\r\nof the page, who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. I cannot\r\ndoubt that Stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and\r\nthat for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.\r\n\r\n\"We had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got\r\naway from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back\r\nmy own name to me through the cabman. From that moment he understood\r\nthat I had taken over the case in London, and that therefore there was\r\nno chance for him there. He returned to Dartmoor and awaited the arrival\r\nof the baronet.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment!\" said I. \"You have, no doubt, described the sequence\r\nof events correctly, but there is one point which you have left\r\nunexplained. What became of the hound when its master was in London?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of\r\nimportance. There can be no question that Stapleton had a confidant,\r\nthough it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by\r\nsharing all his plans with him. There was an old manservant at Merripit\r\nHouse, whose name was Anthony. His connection with the Stapletons can\r\nbe traced for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,\r\nso that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really\r\nhusband and wife. This man has disappeared and has escaped from the\r\ncountry. It is suggestive that Anthony is not a common name in England,\r\nwhile Antonio is so in all Spanish or Spanish-American countries. The\r\nman, like Mrs. Stapleton herself, spoke good English, but with a curious\r\nlisping accent. I have myself seen this old man cross the Grimpen\r\nMire by the path which Stapleton had marked out. It is very probable,\r\ntherefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the\r\nhound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast\r\nwas used.\r\n\r\n\"The Stapletons then went down to Devonshire, whither they were soon\r\nfollowed by Sir Henry and you. One word now as to how I stood myself at\r\nthat time. It may possibly recur to your memory that when I examined\r\nthe paper upon which the printed words were fastened I made a close\r\ninspection for the water-mark. In doing so I held it within a few inches\r\nof my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as\r\nwhite jessamine. There are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very\r\nnecessary that a criminal expert should be able to distinguish from each\r\nother, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended\r\nupon their prompt recognition. The scent suggested the presence of a\r\nlady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the Stapletons. Thus\r\nI had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before\r\never we went to the west country.\r\n\r\n\"It was my game to watch Stapleton. It was evident, however, that I\r\ncould not do this if I were with you, since he would be keenly on his\r\nguard. I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came\r\ndown secretly when I was supposed to be in London. My hardships were\r\nnot so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never\r\ninterfere with the investigation of a case. I stayed for the most\r\npart at Coombe Tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was\r\nnecessary to be near the scene of action. Cartwright had come down with\r\nme, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance\r\nto me. I was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. When I was\r\nwatching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently watching you, so that I\r\nwas able to keep my hand upon all the strings.\r\n\r\n\"I have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being\r\nforwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of\r\ngreat service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece\r\nof biography of Stapleton's. I was able to establish the identity of\r\nthe man and the woman and knew at last exactly how I stood. The case\r\nhad been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped\r\nconvict and the relations between him and the Barrymores. This also you\r\ncleared up in a very effective way, though I had already come to the\r\nsame conclusions from my own observations.\r\n\r\n\"By the time that you discovered me upon the moor I had a complete\r\nknowledge of the whole business, but I had not a case which could go to\r\na jury. Even Stapleton's attempt upon Sir Henry that night which ended\r\nin the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving\r\nmurder against our man. There seemed to be no alternative but to\r\ncatch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use Sir Henry, alone and\r\napparently unprotected, as a bait. We did so, and at the cost of a\r\nsevere shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and\r\ndriving Stapleton to his destruction. That Sir Henry should have been\r\nexposed to this is, I must confess, a reproach to my management of the\r\ncase, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing\r\nspectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which\r\nenabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. We succeeded in our\r\nobject at a cost which both the specialist and Dr. Mortimer assure me\r\nwill be a temporary one. A long journey may enable our friend to recover\r\nnot only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings.\r\nHis love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part\r\nof all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.\r\n\r\n\"It only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.\r\nThere can be no doubt that Stapleton exercised an influence over her\r\nwhich may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,\r\nsince they are by no means incompatible emotions. It was, at least,\r\nabsolutely effective. At his command she consented to pass as his\r\nsister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he\r\nendeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. She was ready to\r\nwarn Sir Henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and\r\nagain and again she tried to do so. Stapleton himself seems to have been\r\ncapable of jealousy, and when he saw the baronet paying court to the\r\nlady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help\r\ninterrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul\r\nwhich his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. By encouraging\r\nthe intimacy he made it certain that Sir Henry would frequently come\r\nto Merripit House and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity\r\nwhich he desired. On the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned\r\nsuddenly against him. She had learned something of the death of the\r\nconvict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on\r\nthe evening that Sir Henry was coming to dinner. She taxed her husband\r\nwith his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed\r\nher for the first time that she had a rival in his love. Her fidelity\r\nturned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray\r\nhim. He tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning\r\nSir Henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put\r\ndown the baronet's death to the curse of his family, as they certainly\r\nwould do, he could win his wife back to accept an accomplished fact and\r\nto keep silent upon what she knew. In this I fancy that in any case\r\nhe made a miscalculation, and that, if we had not been there, his doom\r\nwould none the less have been sealed. A woman of Spanish blood does\r\nnot condone such an injury so lightly. And now, my dear Watson, without\r\nreferring to my notes, I cannot give you a more detailed account of\r\nthis curious case. I do not know that anything essential has been left\r\nunexplained.\"\r\n\r\n\"He could not hope to frighten Sir Henry to death as he had done the old\r\nuncle with his bogie hound.\"\r\n\r\n\"The beast was savage and half-starved. If its appearance did not\r\nfrighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance\r\nwhich might be offered.\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt. There only remains one difficulty. If Stapleton came into the\r\nsuccession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been\r\nliving unannounced under another name so close to the property? How\r\ncould he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a formidable difficulty, and I fear that you ask too much when\r\nyou expect me to solve it. The past and the present are within the field\r\nof my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question\r\nto answer. Mrs. Stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on\r\nseveral occasions. There were three possible courses. He might claim the\r\nproperty from South America, establish his identity before the British\r\nauthorities there and so obtain the fortune without ever coming to\r\nEngland at all, or he might adopt an elaborate disguise during the\r\nshort time that he need be in London; or, again, he might furnish an\r\naccomplice with the proofs and papers, putting him in as heir, and\r\nretaining a claim upon some proportion of his income. We cannot doubt\r\nfrom what we know of him that he would have found some way out of the\r\ndifficulty. And now, my dear Watson, we have had some weeks of severe\r\nwork, and for one evening, I think, we may turn our thoughts into more\r\npleasant channels. I have a box for 'Les Huguenots.' Have you heard the\r\nDe Reszkes? Might I trouble you then to be ready in half an hour, and we\r\ncan stop at Marcini's for a little dinner on the way?\"\r\n\n", "The Boscombe Valley Mystery": "We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the\r\nmaid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran\r\nin this way:\r\n\r\n\"Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from\r\nthe west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.\r\nShall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.\r\nLeave Paddington by the 11:15.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, dear?\" said my wife, looking across at me.\r\n\"Will you go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at\r\npresent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking\r\na little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,\r\nand you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained\r\nthrough one of them,\" I answered. \"But if I am to go, I must pack\r\nat once, for I have only half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nMy experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the\r\neffect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were\r\nfew and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a\r\ncab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock\r\nHolmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt\r\nfigure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey\r\ntravelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.\r\n\r\n\"It is really very good of you to come, Watson,\" said he. \"It\r\nmakes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on\r\nwhom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless\r\nor else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall\r\nget the tickets.\"\r\n\r\nWe had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of\r\npapers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged\r\nand read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until\r\nwe were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a\r\ngigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.\r\n\r\n\"Have you heard anything of the case?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days.\"\r\n\r\n\"The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just\r\nbeen looking through all the recent papers in order to master the\r\nparticulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those\r\nsimple cases which are so extremely difficult.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds a little paradoxical.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a\r\nclue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more\r\ndifficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they\r\nhave established a very serious case against the son of the\r\nmurdered man.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a murder, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for\r\ngranted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into\r\nit. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have\r\nbeen able to understand it, in a very few words.\r\n\r\n\"Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in\r\nHerefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a\r\nMr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned\r\nsome years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he\r\nheld, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was\r\nalso an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the\r\ncolonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to\r\nsettle down they should do so as near each other as possible.\r\nTurner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his\r\ntenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect\r\nequality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,\r\na lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same\r\nage, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have\r\navoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to\r\nhave led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of\r\nsport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the\r\nneighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.\r\nTurner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the\r\nleast. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the\r\nfamilies. Now for the facts.\r\n\r\n\"On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at\r\nHatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the\r\nBoscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out\r\nof the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been\r\nout with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told\r\nthe man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of\r\nimportance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came\r\nback alive.\r\n\r\n\"From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a\r\nmile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One\r\nwas an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was\r\nWilliam Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both\r\nthese witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The\r\ngame-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.\r\nMcCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the\r\nsame way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the\r\nfather was actually in sight at the time, and the son was\r\nfollowing him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in\r\nthe evening of the tragedy that had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,\r\nthe game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly\r\nwooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the\r\nedge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of\r\nthe lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the\r\nwoods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she\r\nsaw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.\r\nMcCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a\r\nviolent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very\r\nstrong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his\r\nhand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their\r\nviolence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached\r\nhome that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near\r\nBoscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to\r\nfight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came\r\nrunning up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead\r\nin the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was\r\nmuch excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right\r\nhand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On\r\nfollowing him they found the dead body stretched out upon the\r\ngrass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated\r\nblows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as\r\nmight very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's\r\ngun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the\r\nbody. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly\r\narrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned\r\nat the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the\r\nmagistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next\r\nAssizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out\r\nbefore the coroner and the police-court.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could hardly imagine a more damning case,\" I remarked. \"If\r\never circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing,\" answered Holmes\r\nthoughtfully. \"It may seem to point very straight to one thing,\r\nbut if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it\r\npointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something\r\nentirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case\r\nlooks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very\r\npossible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people\r\nin the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the\r\ndaughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his\r\ninnocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect\r\nin connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in\r\nhis interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the\r\ncase to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are\r\nflying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly\r\ndigesting their breakfasts at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid,\" said I, \"that the facts are so obvious that you\r\nwill find little credit to be gained out of this case.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact,\" he\r\nanswered, laughing. \"Besides, we may chance to hit upon some\r\nother obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to\r\nMr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting\r\nwhen I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by\r\nmeans which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of\r\nunderstanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly\r\nperceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand\r\nside, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted\r\neven so self-evident a thing as that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How on earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness\r\nwhich characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this\r\nseason you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less\r\nand less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until\r\nit becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the\r\njaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated\r\nthan the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking\r\nat himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a\r\nresult. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and\r\ninference. Therein lies my metier, and it is just possible that\r\nit may be of some service in the investigation which lies before\r\nus. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in\r\nthe inquest, and which are worth considering.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after\r\nthe return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary\r\ninforming him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not\r\nsurprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.\r\nThis observation of his had the natural effect of removing any\r\ntraces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the\r\ncoroner's jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a confession,\" I ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at\r\nleast a most suspicious remark.\"\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary,\" said Holmes, \"it is the brightest rift which I\r\ncan at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,\r\nhe could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the\r\ncircumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared\r\nsurprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I\r\nshould have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such\r\nsurprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,\r\nand yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His\r\nfrank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent\r\nman, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and\r\nfirmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not\r\nunnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of\r\nhis father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day\r\nso far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and\r\neven, according to the little girl whose evidence is so\r\nimportant, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The\r\nself-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark\r\nappear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a\r\nguilty one.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head. \"Many men have been hanged on far slighter\r\nevidence,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the young man's own account of the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,\r\nthough there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.\r\nYou will find it here, and may read it for yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire\r\npaper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the\r\nparagraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own\r\nstatement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the\r\ncorner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called\r\nand gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for\r\nthree days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the\r\nmorning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at\r\nthe time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he\r\nhad driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after\r\nmy return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,\r\nlooking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out\r\nof the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was\r\ngoing. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of\r\nthe Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit\r\nwarren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William\r\nCrowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but\r\nhe is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had\r\nno idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards\r\nfrom the pool I heard a cry of \"Cooee!\" which was a usual signal\r\nbetween my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found\r\nhim standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at\r\nseeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A\r\nconversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,\r\nfor my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his\r\npassion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned\r\ntowards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,\r\nhowever, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me\r\nto run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,\r\nwith his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in\r\nmy arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for\r\nsome minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,\r\nhis house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one\r\nnear my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by\r\nhis injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and\r\nforbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no\r\nactive enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before\r\nhe died?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some\r\nallusion to a rat.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: What did you understand by that?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was\r\ndelirious.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father\r\nhad this final quarrel?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: I should prefer not to answer.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.\r\n\r\n\"Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can\r\nassure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point\r\nout to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case\r\nconsiderably in any future proceedings which may arise.\r\n\r\n\"Witness: I must still refuse.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common\r\nsignal between you and your father?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: It was.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw\r\nyou, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?\r\n\r\n\"Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.\r\n\r\n\"A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions\r\nwhen you returned on hearing the cry and found your father\r\nfatally injured?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: Nothing definite.\r\n\r\n\"The Coroner: What do you mean?\r\n\r\n\"Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into\r\nthe open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet\r\nI have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay\r\nupon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be\r\nsomething grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.\r\nWhen I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, it was gone.'\r\n\r\n\"'You cannot say what it was?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I had a feeling something was there.'\r\n\r\n\"'How far from the body?'\r\n\r\n\"'A dozen yards or so.'\r\n\r\n\"'And how far from the edge of the wood?'\r\n\r\n\"'About the same.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen\r\nyards of it?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes, but with my back towards it.'\r\n\r\n\"This concluded the examination of the witness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said I as I glanced down the column, \"that the coroner\r\nin his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.\r\nHe calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his\r\nfather having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his\r\nrefusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and\r\nhis singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,\r\nas he remarks, very much against the son.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon\r\nthe cushioned seat. \"Both you and the coroner have been at some\r\npains,\" said he, \"to single out the very strongest points in the\r\nyoung man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him\r\ncredit for having too much imagination and too little? Too\r\nlittle, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would\r\ngive him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from\r\nhis own inner consciousness anything so outre as a dying\r\nreference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,\r\nsir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what\r\nthis young man says is true, and we shall see whither that\r\nhypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and\r\nnot another word shall I say of this case until we are on the\r\nscene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be\r\nthere in twenty minutes.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through\r\nthe beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,\r\nfound ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A\r\nlean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for\r\nus upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and\r\nleather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic\r\nsurroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of\r\nScotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a\r\nroom had already been engaged for us.\r\n\r\n\"I have ordered a carriage,\" said Lestrade as we sat over a cup\r\nof tea. \"I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be\r\nhappy until you had been on the scene of the crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was very nice and complimentary of you,\" Holmes answered. \"It\r\nis entirely a question of barometric pressure.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade looked startled. \"I do not quite follow,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud\r\nin the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need\r\nsmoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country\r\nhotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I\r\nshall use the carriage to-night.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed indulgently. \"You have, no doubt, already formed\r\nyour conclusions from the newspapers,\" he said. \"The case is as\r\nplain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer\r\nit becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a\r\nvery positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your\r\nopinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing\r\nwhich you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my\r\nsoul! here is her carriage at the door.\"\r\n\r\nHe had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the\r\nmost lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her\r\nviolet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her\r\ncheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her\r\noverpowering excitement and concern.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!\" she cried, glancing from one to the\r\nother of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,\r\nfastening upon my companion, \"I am so glad that you have come. I\r\nhave driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.\r\nI know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,\r\ntoo. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each\r\nother since we were little children, and I know his faults as no\r\none else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a\r\ncharge is absurd to anyone who really knows him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\"You may rely upon my doing all that I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?\r\nDo you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself\r\nthink that he is innocent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that it is very probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, now!\" she cried, throwing back her head and looking\r\ndefiantly at Lestrade. \"You hear! He gives me hopes.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am afraid that my colleague\r\nhas been a little quick in forming his conclusions,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did\r\nit. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the\r\nreason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because\r\nI was concerned in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had\r\nmany disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that\r\nthere should be a marriage between us. James and I have always\r\nloved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young\r\nand has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he\r\nnaturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there\r\nwere quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And your father?\" asked Holmes. \"Was he in favour of such a\r\nunion?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in\r\nfavour of it.\" A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as\r\nHolmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you for this information,\" said he. \"May I see your father\r\nif I call to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid the doctor won't allow it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for\r\nyears back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken\r\nto his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his\r\nnervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive\r\nwho had known dad in the old days in Victoria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! In Victoria! That is important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, at the mines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner\r\nmade his money.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you\r\nwill go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do\r\ntell him that I know him to be innocent.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, Miss Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if\r\nI leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking.\" She\r\nhurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we\r\nheard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed of you, Holmes,\" said Lestrade with dignity after a\r\nfew minutes' silence. \"Why should you raise up hopes which you\r\nare bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I\r\ncall it cruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy,\" said\r\nHolmes. \"Have you an order to see him in prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but only for you and me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have\r\nstill time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ample.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very\r\nslow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours.\"\r\n\r\nI walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through\r\nthe streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,\r\nwhere I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a\r\nyellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,\r\nhowever, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were\r\ngroping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the\r\naction to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and\r\ngave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the\r\nday. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were\r\nabsolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely\r\nunforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between\r\nthe time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,\r\ndrawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was\r\nsomething terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the\r\nnature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?\r\nI rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which\r\ncontained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's\r\ndeposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left\r\nparietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been\r\nshattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot\r\nupon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from\r\nbehind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when\r\nseen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it\r\ndid not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his\r\nback before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call\r\nHolmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying\r\nreference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be\r\ndelirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become\r\ndelirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how\r\nhe met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my\r\nbrains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident\r\nof the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the\r\nmurderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his\r\novercoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to\r\nreturn and to carry it away at the instant when the son was\r\nkneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a\r\ntissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I\r\ndid not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith\r\nin Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long\r\nas every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young\r\nMcCarthy's innocence.\r\n\r\nIt was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,\r\nfor Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.\r\n\r\n\"The glass still keeps very high,\" he remarked as he sat down.\r\n\"It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able\r\nto go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his\r\nvery best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not\r\nwish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young\r\nMcCarthy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you learn from him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could he throw no light?\"\r\n\r\n\"None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew\r\nwho had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced\r\nnow that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very\r\nquick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,\r\nsound at heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot admire his taste,\" I remarked, \"if it is indeed a fact\r\nthat he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as\r\nthis Miss Turner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,\r\ninsanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was\r\nonly a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away\r\nfive years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get\r\ninto the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a\r\nregistry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can\r\nimagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not\r\ndoing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows\r\nto be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort\r\nwhich made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,\r\nat their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss\r\nTurner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,\r\nand his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would\r\nhave thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with\r\nhis barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in\r\nBristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that\r\npoint. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,\r\nfor the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious\r\ntrouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and\r\nhas written to him to say that she has a husband already in the\r\nBermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I\r\nthink that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all\r\nthat he has suffered.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if he is innocent, who has done it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two\r\npoints. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with\r\nsomeone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his\r\nson, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would\r\nreturn. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry\r\n'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the\r\ncrucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk\r\nabout George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all\r\nminor matters until to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke\r\nbright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with\r\nthe carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe\r\nPool.\r\n\r\n\"There is serious news this morning,\" Lestrade observed. \"It is\r\nsaid that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is\r\ndespaired of.\"\r\n\r\n\"An elderly man, I presume?\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life\r\nabroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This\r\nbusiness has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend\r\nof McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I\r\nhave learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! That is interesting,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody\r\nabout here speaks of his kindness to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this\r\nMcCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have\r\nbeen under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of\r\nmarrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,\r\nheiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,\r\nas if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would\r\nfollow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself\r\nwas averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not\r\ndeduce something from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have got to the deductions and the inferences,\" said\r\nLestrade, winking at me. \"I find it hard enough to tackle facts,\r\nHolmes, without flying away after theories and fancies.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" said Holmes demurely; \"you do find it very hard\r\nto tackle the facts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it\r\ndifficult to get hold of,\" replied Lestrade with some warmth.\r\n\r\n\"And that is--\"\r\n\r\n\"That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that\r\nall theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog,\" said Holmes,\r\nlaughing. \"But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley\r\nFarm upon the left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is it.\" It was a widespread, comfortable-looking\r\nbuilding, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches\r\nof lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless\r\nchimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight\r\nof this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,\r\nwhen the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her\r\nmaster wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the\r\nson's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured\r\nthese very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes\r\ndesired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed\r\nthe winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent\r\nas this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of\r\nBaker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed\r\nand darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,\r\nwhile his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.\r\nHis face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips\r\ncompressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,\r\nsinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal\r\nlust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated\r\nupon the matter before him that a question or remark fell\r\nunheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,\r\nimpatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way\r\nalong the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of\r\nthe woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is\r\nall that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon\r\nthe path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either\r\nside. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and\r\nonce he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and\r\nI walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,\r\nwhile I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the\r\nconviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a\r\ndefinite end.\r\n\r\nThe Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water\r\nsome fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the\r\nHatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.\r\nAbove the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see\r\nthe red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich\r\nlandowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods\r\ngrew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass\r\ntwenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds\r\nwhich lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which\r\nthe body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,\r\nthat I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the\r\nfall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager\r\nface and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read\r\nupon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking\r\nup a scent, and then turned upon my companion.\r\n\r\n\"What did you go into the pool for?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon\r\nor other trace. But how on earth--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its\r\ninward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and\r\nthere it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all\r\nhave been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo\r\nand wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the\r\nlodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or\r\neight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of\r\nthe same feet.\" He drew out a lens and lay down upon his\r\nwaterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to\r\nhimself than to us. \"These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he\r\nwas walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are\r\ndeeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his\r\nstory. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are\r\nthe father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It\r\nis the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?\r\nHa, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite\r\nunusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course\r\nthat was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?\" He ran up\r\nand down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we\r\nwere well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a\r\ngreat beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced\r\nhis way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon\r\nhis face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he\r\nremained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,\r\ngathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and\r\nexamining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of\r\nthe tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among\r\nthe moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then\r\nhe followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the\r\nhighroad, where all traces were lost.\r\n\r\n\"It has been a case of considerable interest,\" he remarked,\r\nreturning to his natural manner. \"I fancy that this grey house on\r\nthe right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a\r\nword with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done\r\nthat, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,\r\nand I shall be with you presently.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove\r\nback into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he\r\nhad picked up in the wood.\r\n\r\n\"This may interest you, Lestrade,\" he remarked, holding it out.\r\n\"The murder was done with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no marks.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are none.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few\r\ndays. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It\r\ncorresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other\r\nweapon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the murderer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears\r\nthick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian\r\ncigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his\r\npocket. There are several other indications, but these may be\r\nenough to aid us in our search.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade laughed. \"I am afraid that I am still a sceptic,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a\r\nhard-headed British jury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nous verrons,\" answered Holmes calmly. \"You work your own\r\nmethod, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,\r\nand shall probably return to London by the evening train.\"\r\n\r\n\"And leave your case unfinished?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, finished.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the mystery?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is solved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was the criminal, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman I describe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a\r\npopulous neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade shrugged his shoulders. \"I am a practical man,\" he said,\r\n\"and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking\r\nfor a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the\r\nlaughing-stock of Scotland Yard.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Holmes quietly. \"I have given you the chance.\r\nHere are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before\r\nI leave.\"\r\n\r\nHaving left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where\r\nwe found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in\r\nthought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds\r\nhimself in a perplexing position.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Watson,\" he said when the cloth was cleared \"just sit\r\ndown in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't\r\nknow quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a\r\ncigar and let me expound.\"\r\n\r\n \"Pray do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about\r\nyoung McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,\r\nalthough they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One\r\nwas the fact that his father should, according to his account,\r\ncry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying\r\nreference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but\r\nthat was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double\r\npoint our research must commence, and we will begin it by\r\npresuming that what the lad says is absolutely true.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of this 'Cooee!' then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The\r\nson, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that\r\nhe was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the\r\nattention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But\r\n'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used\r\nbetween Australians. There is a strong presumption that the\r\nperson whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was\r\nsomeone who had been in Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of the rat, then?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened\r\nit out on the table. \"This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,\"\r\nhe said. \"I wired to Bristol for it last night.\" He put his hand\r\nover part of the map. \"What do you read?\"\r\n\r\n\"ARAT,\" I read.\r\n\r\n\"And now?\" He raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\"BALLARAT.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his\r\nson only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter\r\nthe name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is wonderful!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down\r\nconsiderably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point\r\nwhich, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a\r\ncertainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite\r\nconception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only\r\nbe approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could\r\nhardly wander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the\r\nground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that\r\nimbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you gain them?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of\r\ntrifles.\"\r\n\r\n\"His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length\r\nof his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they were peculiar boots.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his lameness?\"\r\n\r\n\"The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than\r\nhis left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he\r\nwas lame.\"\r\n\r\n\"But his left-handedness.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded\r\nby the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from\r\nimmediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can\r\nthat be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind\r\nthat tree during the interview between the father and son. He had\r\neven smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special\r\nknowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian\r\ncigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and\r\nwritten a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different\r\nvarieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the\r\nash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss\r\nwhere he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety\r\nwhich are rolled in Rotterdam.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the cigar-holder?\"\r\n\r\n\"I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he\r\nused a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the\r\ncut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I said, \"you have drawn a net round this man from which\r\nhe cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as\r\ntruly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the\r\ndirection in which all this points. The culprit is--\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. John Turner,\" cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of\r\nour sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His\r\nslow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of\r\ndecrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and\r\nhis enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual\r\nstrength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled\r\nhair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air\r\nof dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an\r\nashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were\r\ntinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that\r\nhe was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.\r\n\r\n\"Pray sit down on the sofa,\" said Holmes gently. \"You had my\r\nnote?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to\r\nsee me here to avoid scandal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why did you wish to see me?\" He looked across at my\r\ncompanion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question\r\nwas already answered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. \"It\r\nis so. I know all about McCarthy.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man sank his face in his hands. \"God help me!\" he cried.\r\n\"But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you\r\nmy word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at\r\nthe Assizes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to hear you say so,\" said Holmes gravely.\r\n\r\n\"I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It\r\nwould break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears\r\nthat I am arrested.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may not come to that,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter\r\nwho required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.\r\nYoung McCarthy must be got off, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a dying man,\" said old Turner. \"I have had diabetes for\r\nyears. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a\r\nmonth. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand\r\nand a bundle of paper before him. \"Just tell us the truth,\" he\r\nsaid. \"I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson\r\nhere can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the\r\nlast extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall\r\nnot use it unless it is absolutely needed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's as well,\" said the old man; \"it's a question whether I\r\nshall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I\r\nshould wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the\r\nthing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but\r\nwill not take me long to tell.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil\r\nincarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of\r\nsuch a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,\r\nand he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be\r\nin his power.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap\r\nthen, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at\r\nanything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck\r\nwith my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you\r\nwould call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and\r\nwe had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time\r\nto time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.\r\nBlack Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party\r\nis still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.\r\n\r\n\"One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and\r\nwe lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers\r\nand six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of\r\ntheir saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,\r\nhowever, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of\r\nthe wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the\r\nLord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his\r\nwicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every\r\nfeature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made\r\nour way over to England without being suspected. There I parted\r\nfrom my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and\r\nrespectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in\r\nthe market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,\r\nto make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,\r\nand though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.\r\nEven when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down\r\nthe right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned\r\nover a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was\r\ngoing well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.\r\n\r\n\"I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in\r\nRegent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\"'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be\r\nas good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and\r\nyou can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,\r\nlaw-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman\r\nwithin hail.'\r\n\r\n\"Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking\r\nthem off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land\r\never since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;\r\nturn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my\r\nelbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more\r\nafraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he\r\nwanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without\r\nquestion, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing\r\nwhich I could not give. He asked for Alice.\r\n\r\n\"His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was\r\nknown to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that\r\nhis lad should step into the whole property. But there I was\r\nfirm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that\r\nI had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that\r\nwas enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do\r\nhis worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses\r\nto talk it over.\r\n\r\n\"When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I\r\nsmoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.\r\nBut as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in\r\nme seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my\r\ndaughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she\r\nwere a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I\r\nand all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a\r\nman as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and\r\na desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,\r\nI knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!\r\nBoth could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I\r\ndid it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,\r\nI have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl\r\nshould be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more\r\nthan I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction\r\nthan if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought\r\nback his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I\r\nwas forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in\r\nmy flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that\r\noccurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it is not for me to judge you,\" said Holmes as the old man\r\nsigned the statement which had been drawn out. \"I pray that we\r\nmay never be exposed to such a temptation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you\r\nwill soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the\r\nAssizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is\r\ncondemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be\r\nseen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or\r\ndead, shall be safe with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, then,\" said the old man solemnly. \"Your own deathbeds,\r\nwhen they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace\r\nwhich you have given to mine.\" Tottering and shaking in all his\r\ngiant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.\r\n\r\n\"God help us!\" said Holmes after a long silence. \"Why does fate\r\nplay such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such\r\na case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,\r\n'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'\"\r\n\r\nJames McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a\r\nnumber of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and\r\nsubmitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven\r\nmonths after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is\r\nevery prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily\r\ntogether in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their\r\npast.\r\n", "The Five Orange Pips": "When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes\r\ncases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which\r\npresent strange and interesting features that it is no easy\r\nmatter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,\r\nhave already gained publicity through the papers, and others have\r\nnot offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend\r\npossessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of\r\nthese papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his\r\nanalytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without\r\nan ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and\r\nhave their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and\r\nsurmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to\r\nhim. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable\r\nin its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted\r\nto give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are\r\npoints in connection with it which never have been, and probably\r\nnever will be, entirely cleared up.\r\n\r\nThe year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater\r\nor less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my\r\nheadings under this one twelve months I find an account of the\r\nadventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant\r\nSociety, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a\r\nfurniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the\r\nBritish barque \"Sophy Anderson\", of the singular adventures of the\r\nGrice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the\r\nCamberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,\r\nSherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to\r\nprove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that\r\ntherefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a\r\ndeduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the\r\ncase. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of\r\nthem present such singular features as the strange train of\r\ncircumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales\r\nhad set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had\r\nscreamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that\r\neven here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced\r\nto raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and\r\nto recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which\r\nshriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like\r\nuntamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew\r\nhigher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in\r\nthe chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the\r\nfireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the\r\nother was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until\r\nthe howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,\r\nand the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of\r\nthe sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a\r\nfew days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker\r\nStreet.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said I, glancing up at my companion, \"that was surely the\r\nbell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Except yourself I have none,\" he answered. \"I do not encourage\r\nvisitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"A client, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out\r\non such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more\r\nlikely to be some crony of the landlady's.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there\r\ncame a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He\r\nstretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and\r\ntowards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.\r\n\r\n\"Come in!\" said he.\r\n\r\nThe man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the\r\noutside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of\r\nrefinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella\r\nwhich he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told\r\nof the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about\r\nhim anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his\r\nface was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is\r\nweighed down with some great anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I owe you an apology,\" he said, raising his golden pince-nez to\r\nhis eyes. \"I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have\r\nbrought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug\r\nchamber.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your coat and umbrella,\" said Holmes. \"They may rest\r\nhere on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from\r\nthe south-west, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, from Horsham.\"\r\n\r\n\"That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is\r\nquite distinctive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have come for advice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is easily got.\"\r\n\r\n\"And help.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not always so easy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast\r\nhow you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said that you could solve anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"He said too much.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you are never beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is that compared with the number of your successes?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true that I have been generally successful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may be so with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me\r\nwith some details as to your case.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no ordinary one.\"\r\n\r\n\"None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of\r\nappeal.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you\r\nhave ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of\r\nevents than those which have happened in my own family.\"\r\n\r\n\"You fill me with interest,\" said Holmes. \"Pray give us the\r\nessential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards\r\nquestion you as to those details which seem to me to be most\r\nimportant.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out\r\ntowards the blaze.\r\n\r\n\"My name,\" said he, \"is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,\r\nas far as I can understand, little to do with this awful\r\nbusiness. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an\r\nidea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the\r\naffair.\r\n\r\n\"You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias\r\nand my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,\r\nwhich he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He\r\nwas a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business\r\nmet with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire\r\nupon a handsome competence.\r\n\r\n\"My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and\r\nbecame a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done\r\nvery well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,\r\nand afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When\r\nLee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where\r\nhe remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came\r\nback to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.\r\nHe had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his\r\nreason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his\r\ndislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to\r\nthem. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very\r\nfoul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring\r\ndisposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I\r\ndoubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or\r\nthree fields round his house, and there he would take his\r\nexercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave\r\nhis room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very\r\nheavily, but he would see no society and did not want any\r\nfriends, not even his own brother.\r\n\r\n\"He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the\r\ntime when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This\r\nwould be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years\r\nin England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he\r\nwas very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be\r\nfond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would\r\nmake me his representative both with the servants and with the\r\ntradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite\r\nmaster of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I\r\nliked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in\r\nhis privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he\r\nhad a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was\r\ninvariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or\r\nanyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped\r\nthrough the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a\r\ncollection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such\r\na room.\r\n\r\n\"One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp\r\nlay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a\r\ncommon thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all\r\npaid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From\r\nIndia!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can\r\nthis be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little\r\ndried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to\r\nlaugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight\r\nof his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his\r\nskin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he\r\nstill held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and\r\nthen, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'\r\n\r\n\"'What is it, uncle?' I cried.\r\n\r\n\"'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his\r\nroom, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope\r\nand saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the\r\ngum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else\r\nsave the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his\r\noverpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I\r\nascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,\r\nwhich must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small\r\nbrass box, like a cashbox, in the other.\r\n\r\n\"'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'\r\nsaid he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my\r\nroom to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'\r\n\r\n\"I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to\r\nstep up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the\r\ngrate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned\r\npaper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I\r\nglanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was\r\nprinted the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the\r\nenvelope.\r\n\r\n\"'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave\r\nmy estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to\r\nmy brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to\r\nyou. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you\r\ncannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest\r\nenemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't\r\nsay what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper\r\nwhere Mr. Fordham shows you.'\r\n\r\n\"I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with\r\nhim. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest\r\nimpression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every\r\nway in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I\r\ncould not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left\r\nbehind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed\r\nand nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I\r\ncould see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,\r\nand he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his\r\ntime he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the\r\ninside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy\r\nand would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a\r\nrevolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,\r\nand that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by\r\nman or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would\r\nrush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,\r\nlike a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror\r\nwhich lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen\r\nhis face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it\r\nwere new raised from a basin.\r\n\r\n\"Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to\r\nabuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those\r\ndrunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when\r\nwe went to search for him, face downward in a little\r\ngreen-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There\r\nwas no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,\r\nso that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,\r\nbrought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced\r\nfrom the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself\r\nthat he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,\r\nhowever, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and\r\nof some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" Holmes interposed, \"your statement is, I foresee,\r\none of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me\r\nhave the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and\r\nthe date of his supposed suicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks\r\nlater, upon the night of May 2nd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Pray proceed.\"\r\n\r\n\"When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my\r\nrequest, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been\r\nalways locked up. We found the brass box there, although its\r\ncontents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a\r\npaper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and\r\n'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.\r\nThese, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had\r\nbeen destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was\r\nnothing of much importance in the attic save a great many\r\nscattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in\r\nAmerica. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had\r\ndone his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.\r\nOthers were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern\r\nstates, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had\r\nevidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag\r\npoliticians who had been sent down from the North.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at\r\nHorsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the\r\nJanuary of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my\r\nfather give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the\r\nbreakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened\r\nenvelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the\r\noutstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what\r\nhe called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked\r\nvery scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are\r\nthe very letters. But what is this written above them?'\r\n\r\n\"'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.\r\n\r\n\"'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the\r\npapers must be those that are destroyed.'\r\n\r\n\"'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a\r\ncivilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.\r\nWhere does the thing come from?'\r\n\r\n\"'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.\r\n\r\n\"'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do\r\nwith sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such\r\nnonsense.'\r\n\r\n\"'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.\r\n\r\n\"'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then let me do so?'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such\r\nnonsense.'\r\n\r\n\"It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate\r\nman. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of\r\nforebodings.\r\n\r\n\"On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went\r\nfrom home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is\r\nin command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad\r\nthat he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from\r\ndanger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in\r\nerror. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram\r\nfrom the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had\r\nfallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the\r\nneighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I\r\nhurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered\r\nhis consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from\r\nFareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,\r\nand the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in\r\nbringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'\r\nCarefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I\r\nwas unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of\r\nmurder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no\r\nrobbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.\r\nAnd yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,\r\nand that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been\r\nwoven round him.\r\n\r\n\"In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me\r\nwhy I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well\r\nconvinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an\r\nincident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as\r\npressing in one house as in another.\r\n\r\n\"It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two\r\nyears and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time\r\nI have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that\r\nthis curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended\r\nwith the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,\r\nhowever; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in\r\nwhich it had come upon my father.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and\r\nturning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried\r\norange pips.\r\n\r\n\"This is the envelope,\" he continued. \"The postmark is\r\nLondon--eastern division. Within are the very words which were\r\nupon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the\r\npapers on the sundial.'\"\r\n\r\n\"What have you done?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell the truth\"--he sank his face into his thin, white\r\nhands--\"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor\r\nrabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in\r\nthe grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight\r\nand no precautions can guard against.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut! tut!\" cried Sherlock Holmes. \"You must act, man, or you are\r\nlost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for\r\ndespair.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the police.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that\r\nthe inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all\r\npractical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really\r\naccidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with\r\nthe warnings.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his clenched hands in the air. \"Incredible\r\nimbecility!\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in\r\nthe house with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has he come with you to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. His orders were to stay in the house.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Holmes raved in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you come to me,\" he cried, \"and, above all, why did you\r\nnot come at once?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major\r\nPrendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have\r\nacted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than\r\nthat which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which\r\nmight help us?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing,\" said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat\r\npocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted\r\npaper, he laid it out upon the table. \"I have some remembrance,\"\r\nsaid he, \"that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I\r\nobserved that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the\r\nashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet\r\nupon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it\r\nmay be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from\r\namong the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond\r\nthe mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think\r\nmyself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is\r\nundoubtedly my uncle's.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,\r\nwhich showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from\r\na book. It was headed, \"March, 1869,\" and beneath were the\r\nfollowing enigmatical notices:\r\n\r\n\"4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.\r\n\r\n\"7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and\r\n      John Swain, of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\n\"9th. McCauley cleared.\r\n\r\n\"10th. John Swain cleared.\r\n\r\n\"12th. Visited Paramore. All well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it\r\nto our visitor. \"And now you must on no account lose another\r\ninstant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told\r\nme. You must get home instantly and act.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must\r\nput this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass\r\nbox which you have described. You must also put in a note to say\r\nthat all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that\r\nthis is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such\r\nwords as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you\r\nmust at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do\r\nyou understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I\r\nthink that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our\r\nweb to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first\r\nconsideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens\r\nyou. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the\r\nguilty parties.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you,\" said the young man, rising and pulling on his\r\novercoat. \"You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall\r\ncertainly do as you advise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in\r\nthe meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that\r\nyou are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you\r\ngo back?\"\r\n\r\n\"By train from Waterloo.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that\r\nyou may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too\r\nclosely.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am armed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall see you at Horsham, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news\r\nas to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every\r\nparticular.\" He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside\r\nthe wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered\r\nagainst the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come\r\nto us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet\r\nof sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk\r\nforward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he\r\nlit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue\r\nsmoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\n\"I think, Watson,\" he remarked at last, \"that of all our cases we\r\nhave had none more fantastic than this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems\r\nto me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the\r\nSholtos.\"\r\n\r\n\"But have you,\" I asked, \"formed any definite conception as to\r\nwhat these perils are?\"\r\n\r\n\"There can be no question as to their nature,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue\r\nthis unhappy family?\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the\r\narms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. \"The ideal\r\nreasoner,\" he remarked, \"would, when he had once been shown a\r\nsingle fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the\r\nchain of events which led up to it but also all the results which\r\nwould follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole\r\nanimal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who\r\nhas thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents\r\nshould be able to accurately state all the other ones, both\r\nbefore and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the\r\nreason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study\r\nwhich have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the\r\naid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest\r\npitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to\r\nutilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this\r\nin itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all\r\nknowledge, which, even in these days of free education and\r\nencyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so\r\nimpossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge\r\nwhich is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have\r\nendeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one\r\noccasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits\r\nin a very precise fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered, laughing. \"It was a singular document.\r\nPhilosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I\r\nremember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the\r\nmud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry\r\neccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime\r\nrecords unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and\r\nself-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the\r\nmain points of my analysis.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes grinned at the last item. \"Well,\" he said, \"I say now, as\r\nI said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic\r\nstocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the\r\nrest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he\r\ncan get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which\r\nhas been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster\r\nall our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the\r\n'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.\r\nThank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be\r\ndeduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong\r\npresumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for\r\nleaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their\r\nhabits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for\r\nthe lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love\r\nof solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of\r\nsomeone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis\r\nthat it was fear of someone or something which drove him from\r\nAmerica. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by\r\nconsidering the formidable letters which were received by himself\r\nand his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those\r\nletters?\"\r\n\r\n\"The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the\r\nthird from London.\"\r\n\r\n\"From East London. What do you deduce from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that\r\nthe probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was\r\non board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the\r\ncase of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and\r\nits fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.\r\nDoes that suggest anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"A greater distance to travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the letter had also a greater distance to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I do not see the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man\r\nor men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send\r\ntheir singular warning or token before them when starting upon\r\ntheir mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign\r\nwhen it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a\r\nsteamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those\r\nseven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which\r\nbrought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the\r\nwriter.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly\r\nurgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to\r\ncaution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which\r\nit would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one\r\ncomes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" I cried. \"What can it mean, this relentless\r\npersecution?\"\r\n\r\n\"The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital\r\nimportance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think\r\nthat it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.\r\nA single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way\r\nas to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in\r\nit, and they must have been men of resource and determination.\r\nTheir papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.\r\nIn this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an\r\nindividual and becomes the badge of a society.\"\r\n\r\n\"But of what society?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you never--\" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and\r\nsinking his voice--\"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never have.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. \"Here it\r\nis,\" said he presently:\r\n\r\n\"'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to\r\nthe sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret\r\nsociety was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the\r\nSouthern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local\r\nbranches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,\r\nLouisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was\r\nused for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of\r\nthe negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country\r\nof those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually\r\npreceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic\r\nbut generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some\r\nparts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this\r\nthe victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might\r\nfly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would\r\nunfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and\r\nunforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the\r\nsociety, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a\r\ncase upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with\r\nimpunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the\r\nperpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite\r\nof the efforts of the United States government and of the better\r\nclasses of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year\r\n1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have\r\nbeen sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'\r\n\r\n\"You will observe,\" said Holmes, laying down the volume, \"that\r\nthe sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the\r\ndisappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may\r\nwell have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his\r\nfamily have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.\r\nYou can understand that this register and diary may implicate\r\nsome of the first men in the South, and that there may be many\r\nwho will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the page we have seen--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent\r\nthe pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to\r\nthem. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or\r\nleft the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a\r\nsinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let\r\nsome light into this dark place, and I believe that the only\r\nchance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have\r\ntold him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done\r\nto-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for\r\nhalf an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable\r\nways of our fellow-men.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a\r\nsubdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the\r\ngreat city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me for not waiting for you,\" said he; \"I have, I\r\nforesee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of\r\nyoung Openshaw's.\"\r\n\r\n\"What steps will you take?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.\r\nI may have to go down to Horsham, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not go there first?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the\r\nmaid will bring up your coffee.\"\r\n\r\nAs I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and\r\nglanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a\r\nchill to my heart.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"you are too late.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said he, laying down his cup, \"I feared as much. How was it\r\ndone?\" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.\r\n\r\n\"My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy\r\nNear Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:\r\n\r\n\"Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H\r\nDivision, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and\r\na splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and\r\nstormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it\r\nwas quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was\r\ngiven, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was\r\neventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman\r\nwhose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his\r\npocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.\r\nIt is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch\r\nthe last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and\r\nthe extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge\r\nof one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body\r\nexhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that\r\nthe deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,\r\nwhich should have the effect of calling the attention of the\r\nauthorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and\r\nshaken than I had ever seen him.\r\n\r\n\"That hurts my pride, Watson,\" he said at last. \"It is a petty\r\nfeeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal\r\nmatter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my\r\nhand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that\r\nI should send him away to his death--!\" He sprang from his chair\r\nand paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a\r\nflush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and\r\nunclasping of his long thin hands.\r\n\r\n\"They must be cunning devils,\" he exclaimed at last. \"How could\r\nthey have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the\r\ndirect line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too\r\ncrowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,\r\nwe shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!\"\r\n\r\n\"To the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may\r\ntake the flies, but not before.\"\r\n\r\nAll day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in\r\nthe evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes\r\nhad not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he\r\nentered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,\r\nand tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,\r\nwashing it down with a long draught of water.\r\n\r\n\"You are hungry,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bite. I had no time to think of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how have you succeeded?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a clue?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not\r\nlong remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish\r\ntrade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he\r\nsqueezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and\r\nthrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote\r\n\"S. H. for J. O.\" Then he sealed it and addressed it to \"Captain\r\nJames Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will await him when he enters port,\" said he, chuckling.\r\n\"It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a\r\nprecursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is this Captain Calhoun?\"\r\n\r\n\"The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you trace it, then?\"\r\n\r\nHe took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with\r\ndates and names.\r\n\r\n\"I have spent the whole day,\" said he, \"over Lloyd's registers\r\nand files of the old papers, following the future career of every\r\nvessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in\r\n'83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were\r\nreported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'\r\ninstantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported\r\nas having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to\r\none of the states of the Union.\"\r\n\r\n\"Texas, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must\r\nhave an American origin.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque\r\n'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a\r\ncertainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present\r\nin the port of London.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the\r\nAlbert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by\r\nthe early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired\r\nto Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and\r\nas the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the\r\nGoodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will you do, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I\r\nlearn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are\r\nFinns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away\r\nfrom the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has\r\nbeen loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship\r\nreaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and\r\nthe cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these\r\nthree gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder.\"\r\n\r\nThere is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,\r\nand the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the\r\norange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as\r\nresolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very\r\nsevere were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for\r\nnews of the \"Lone Star\" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We\r\ndid at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a\r\nshattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough\r\nof a wave, with the letters \"L. S.\" carved upon it, and that is\r\nall which we shall ever know of the fate of the \"Lone Star.\"\r\n", "The Adventure of the Speckled Band": "On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I\r\nhave during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend\r\nSherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number\r\nmerely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did\r\nrather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of\r\nwealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation\r\nwhich did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.\r\nOf all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which\r\npresented more singular features than that which was associated\r\nwith the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.\r\nThe events in question occurred in the early days of my\r\nassociation with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors\r\nin Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them\r\nupon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the\r\ntime, from which I have only been freed during the last month by\r\nthe untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It\r\nis perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I\r\nhave reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the\r\ndeath of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even\r\nmore terrible than the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to\r\nfind Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my\r\nbed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the\r\nmantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I\r\nblinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little\r\nresentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.\r\n\r\n\"Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,\" said he, \"but it's the\r\ncommon lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she\r\nretorted upon me, and I on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then--a fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a\r\nconsiderable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She\r\nis waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander\r\nabout the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock\r\nsleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is\r\nsomething very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it\r\nprove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to\r\nfollow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should\r\ncall you and give you the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything.\"\r\n\r\nI had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his\r\nprofessional investigations, and in admiring the rapid\r\ndeductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a\r\nlogical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were\r\nsubmitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in\r\na few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A\r\nlady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in\r\nthe window, rose as we entered.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, madam,\" said Holmes cheerily. \"My name is Sherlock\r\nHolmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,\r\nbefore whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am\r\nglad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the\r\nfire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot\r\ncoffee, for I observe that you are shivering.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not cold which makes me shiver,\" said the woman in a low\r\nvoice, changing her seat as requested.\r\n\r\n\"What, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror.\" She raised her veil as\r\nshe spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable\r\nstate of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless\r\nfrightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features\r\nand figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot\r\nwith premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.\r\nSherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,\r\nall-comprehensive glances.\r\n\r\n\"You must not fear,\" said he soothingly, bending forward and\r\npatting her forearm. \"We shall soon set matters right, I have no\r\ndoubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know me, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm\r\nof your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had\r\na good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached\r\nthe station.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"There is no mystery, my dear madam,\" said he, smiling. \"The left\r\narm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven\r\nplaces. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a\r\ndog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you\r\nsit on the left-hand side of the driver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,\" said\r\nshe. \"I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at\r\ntwenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I\r\ncan stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.\r\nI have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,\r\nand he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,\r\nMr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you\r\nhelped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had\r\nyour address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,\r\ntoo, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness\r\nwhich surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward\r\nyou for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be\r\nmarried, with the control of my own income, and then at least you\r\nshall not find me ungrateful.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small\r\ncase-book, which he consulted.\r\n\r\n\"Farintosh,\" said he. \"Ah yes, I recall the case; it was\r\nconcerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,\r\nWatson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote\r\nthe same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to\r\nreward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty\r\nto defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which\r\nsuits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us\r\neverything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" replied our visitor, \"the very horror of my situation\r\nlies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions\r\ndepend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to\r\nanother, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to\r\nlook for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it\r\nas the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can\r\nread it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have\r\nheard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold\r\nwickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid\r\nthe dangers which encompass me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am all attention, madam.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who\r\nis the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in\r\nEngland, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of\r\nSurrey.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded his head. \"The name is familiar to me,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the\r\nestates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,\r\nand Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four\r\nsuccessive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,\r\nand the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the\r\ndays of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,\r\nand the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under\r\na heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence\r\nthere, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but\r\nhis only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to\r\nthe new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which\r\nenabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,\r\nwhere, by his professional skill and his force of character, he\r\nestablished a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused\r\nby some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he\r\nbeat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital\r\nsentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and\r\nafterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.\r\n\r\n\"When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,\r\nthe young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.\r\nMy sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old\r\nat the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable\r\nsum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she\r\nbequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,\r\nwith a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to\r\neach of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return\r\nto England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a\r\nrailway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his\r\nattempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us\r\nto live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The\r\nmoney which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and\r\nthere seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.\r\n\r\n\"But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.\r\nInstead of making friends and exchanging visits with our\r\nneighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of\r\nStoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in\r\nhis house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious\r\nquarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper\r\napproaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the\r\nfamily, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been\r\nintensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of\r\ndisgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the\r\npolice-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,\r\nand the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of\r\nimmense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.\r\n\r\n\"Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a\r\nstream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I\r\ncould gather together that I was able to avert another public\r\nexposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,\r\nand he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few\r\nacres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,\r\nand would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,\r\nwandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a\r\npassion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a\r\ncorrespondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,\r\nwhich wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the\r\nvillagers almost as much as their master.\r\n\r\n\"You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I\r\nhad no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with\r\nus, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was\r\nbut thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already\r\nbegun to whiten, even as mine has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sister is dead, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish\r\nto speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I\r\nhave described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own\r\nage and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden\r\nsister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we\r\nwere occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's\r\nhouse. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there\r\na half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My\r\nstepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and\r\noffered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of\r\nthe day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event\r\noccurred which has deprived me of my only companion.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes\r\nclosed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his\r\nlids now and glanced across at his visitor.\r\n\r\n\"Pray be precise as to details,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful\r\ntime is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have\r\nalready said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The\r\nbedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms\r\nbeing in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms\r\nthe first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third\r\nmy own. There is no communication between them, but they all open\r\nout into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly so.\"\r\n\r\n\"The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That\r\nfatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we\r\nknew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled\r\nby the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom\r\nto smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where\r\nshe sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At\r\neleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door\r\nand looked back.\r\n\r\n\"'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle\r\nin the dead of the night?'\r\n\r\n\"'Never,' said I.\r\n\r\n\"'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in\r\nyour sleep?'\r\n\r\n\"'Certainly not. But why?'\r\n\r\n\"'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three\r\nin the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,\r\nand it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps\r\nfrom the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would\r\njust ask you whether you had heard it.'\r\n\r\n\"'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the\r\nplantation.'\r\n\r\n\"'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you\r\ndid not hear it also.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled\r\nback at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her\r\nkey turn in the lock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Holmes. \"Was it your custom always to lock\r\nyourselves in at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah\r\nand a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were\r\nlocked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending\r\nmisfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,\r\nwere twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two\r\nsouls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind\r\nwas howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing\r\nagainst the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,\r\nthere burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew\r\nthat it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a\r\nshawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door\r\nI seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and\r\na few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had\r\nfallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,\r\nand revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it\r\nhorror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By\r\nthe light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the\r\nopening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for\r\nhelp, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a\r\ndrunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that\r\nmoment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.\r\nShe writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were\r\ndreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not\r\nrecognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out\r\nin a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was\r\nthe band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she\r\nwould fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the\r\nair in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion\r\nseized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for\r\nmy stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his\r\ndressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was\r\nunconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent\r\nfor medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for\r\nshe slowly sank and died without having recovered her\r\nconsciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" said Holmes, \"are you sure about this whistle and\r\nmetallic sound? Could you swear to it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is\r\nmy strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of\r\nthe gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have\r\nbeen deceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was your sister dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the\r\ncharred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when\r\nthe alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did\r\nthe coroner come to?\"\r\n\r\n\"He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's\r\nconduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable\r\nto find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that\r\nthe door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows\r\nwere blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,\r\nwhich were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,\r\nand were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was\r\nalso thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is\r\nwide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,\r\ntherefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.\r\nBesides, there were no marks of any violence upon her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about poison?\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctors examined her for it, but without success.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,\r\nthough what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there are nearly always some there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a\r\nspeckled band?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of\r\ndelirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of\r\npeople, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not\r\nknow whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear\r\nover their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which\r\nshe used.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"These are very deep waters,\" said he; \"pray go on with your\r\nnarrative.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until\r\nlately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,\r\nwhom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask\r\nmy hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the\r\nsecond son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My\r\nstepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to\r\nbe married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs\r\nwere started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom\r\nwall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the\r\nchamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in\r\nwhich she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last\r\nnight, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I\r\nsuddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which\r\nhad been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the\r\nlamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to\r\ngo to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was\r\ndaylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which\r\nis opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on\r\nthis morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your\r\nadvice.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done wisely,\" said my friend. \"But have you told me\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nFor answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which\r\nfringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little\r\nlivid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed\r\nupon the white wrist.\r\n\r\n\"You have been cruelly used,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. \"He\r\nis a hard man,\" she said, \"and perhaps he hardly knows his own\r\nstrength.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin\r\nupon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.\r\n\r\n\"This is a very deep business,\" he said at last. \"There are a\r\nthousand details which I should desire to know before I decide\r\nupon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If\r\nwe were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for\r\nus to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your\r\nstepfather?\"\r\n\r\n\"As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some\r\nmost important business. It is probable that he will be away all\r\nday, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a\r\nhousekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily\r\nget her out of the way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am\r\nin town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to\r\nbe there in time for your coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some\r\nsmall business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and\r\nbreakfast?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have\r\nconfided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you\r\nagain this afternoon.\" She dropped her thick black veil over her\r\nface and glided from the room.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you think of it all, Watson?\" asked Sherlock Holmes,\r\nleaning back in his chair.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dark enough and sinister enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls\r\nare sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,\r\nthen her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her\r\nmysterious end.\"\r\n\r\n\"What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the\r\nvery peculiar words of the dying woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of\r\na band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,\r\nthe fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has\r\nan interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying\r\nallusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner\r\nheard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of\r\nthose metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its\r\nplace, I think that there is good ground to think that the\r\nmystery may be cleared along those lines.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what, then, did the gipsies do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see many objections to any such theory.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going\r\nto Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are\r\nfatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of\r\nthe devil!\"\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that\r\nour door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had\r\nframed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar\r\nmixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a\r\nblack top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,\r\nwith a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his\r\nhat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his\r\nbreadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,\r\nseared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and\r\nmarked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other\r\nof us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,\r\nfleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old\r\nbird of prey.\r\n\r\n\"Which of you is Holmes?\" asked this apparition.\r\n\r\n\"My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,\" said my\r\ncompanion quietly.\r\n\r\n\"I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Doctor,\" said Holmes blandly. \"Pray take a seat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I\r\nhave traced her. What has she been saying to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a little cold for the time of the year,\" said Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"What has she been saying to you?\" screamed the old man\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\n\"But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,\" continued my\r\ncompanion imperturbably.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! You put me off, do you?\" said our new visitor, taking a step\r\nforward and shaking his hunting-crop. \"I know you, you scoundrel!\r\nI have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes, the busybody!\"\r\n\r\nHis smile broadened.\r\n\r\n\"Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!\"\r\n\r\nHolmes chuckled heartily. \"Your conversation is most\r\nentertaining,\" said he. \"When you go out close the door, for\r\nthere is a decided draught.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with\r\nmy affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!\r\nI am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here.\" He stepped\r\nswiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with\r\nhis huge brown hands.\r\n\r\n\"See that you keep yourself out of my grip,\" he snarled, and\r\nhurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n\"He seems a very amiable person,\" said Holmes, laughing. \"I am\r\nnot quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him\r\nthat my grip was not much more feeble than his own.\" As he spoke\r\nhe picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,\r\nstraightened it out again.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official\r\ndetective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,\r\nhowever, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer\r\nfrom her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,\r\nWatson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk\r\ndown to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may\r\nhelp us in this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his\r\nexcursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled\r\nover with notes and figures.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen the will of the deceased wife,\" said he. \"To\r\ndetermine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the\r\npresent prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The\r\ntotal income, which at the time of the wife's death was little\r\nshort of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural\r\nprices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an\r\nincome of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have\r\nhad a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to\r\na very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,\r\nsince it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for\r\nstanding in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,\r\nthis is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is\r\naware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you\r\nare ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be\r\nvery much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your\r\npocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen\r\nwho can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush\r\nare, I think, all that we need.\"\r\n\r\nAt Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for\r\nLeatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove\r\nfor four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a\r\nperfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the\r\nheavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out\r\ntheir first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant\r\nsmell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange\r\ncontrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this\r\nsinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in\r\nthe front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over\r\nhis eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the\r\ndeepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the\r\nshoulder, and pointed over the meadows.\r\n\r\n\"Look there!\" said he.\r\n\r\nA heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,\r\nthickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the\r\nbranches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a\r\nvery old mansion.\r\n\r\n\"Stoke Moran?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott,\" remarked\r\nthe driver.\r\n\r\n\"There is some building going on there,\" said Holmes; \"that is\r\nwhere we are going.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's the village,\" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of\r\nroofs some distance to the left; \"but if you want to get to the\r\nhouse, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by\r\nthe foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is\r\nwalking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,\" observed Holmes, shading\r\nhis eyes. \"Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest.\"\r\n\r\nWe got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way\r\nto Leatherhead.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it as well,\" said Holmes as we climbed the stile,\r\n\"that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or\r\non some definite business. It may stop his gossip.\r\nGood-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as\r\nour word.\"\r\n\r\nOur client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a\r\nface which spoke her joy. \"I have been waiting so eagerly for\r\nyou,\" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. \"All has turned\r\nout splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely\r\nthat he will be back before evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,\"\r\nsaid Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had\r\noccurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" she cried, \"he has followed me, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it appears.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What\r\nwill he say when he returns?\"\r\n\r\n\"He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone\r\nmore cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself\r\nup from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to\r\nyour aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our\r\ntime, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to\r\nexamine.\"\r\n\r\nThe building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high\r\ncentral portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,\r\nthrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were\r\nbroken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly\r\ncaved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little\r\nbetter repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,\r\nand the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up\r\nfrom the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.\r\nSome scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the\r\nstone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any\r\nworkmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and\r\ndown the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the\r\noutsides of the windows.\r\n\r\n\"This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,\r\nthe centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main\r\nbuilding to Dr. Roylott's chamber?\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does\r\nnot seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end\r\nwall.\"\r\n\r\n\"There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from\r\nmy room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow\r\nwing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There\r\nare windows in it, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass\r\nthrough.\"\r\n\r\n\"As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were\r\nunapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness\r\nto go into your room and bar your shutters?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination\r\nthrough the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the\r\nshutter open, but without success. There was no slit through\r\nwhich a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his\r\nlens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built\r\nfirmly into the massive masonry. \"Hum!\" said he, scratching his\r\nchin in some perplexity, \"my theory certainly presents some\r\ndifficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were\r\nbolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon\r\nthe matter.\"\r\n\r\nA small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which\r\nthe three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third\r\nchamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss\r\nStoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her\r\nfate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a\r\ngaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A\r\nbrown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow\r\nwhite-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the\r\nleft-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small\r\nwicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save\r\nfor a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and\r\nthe panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old\r\nand discoloured that it may have dated from the original building\r\nof the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat\r\nsilent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,\r\ntaking in every detail of the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Where does that bell communicate with?\" he asked at last\r\npointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the\r\ntassel actually lying upon the pillow.\r\n\r\n\"It goes to the housekeeper's room.\"\r\n\r\n\"It looks newer than the other things?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sister asked for it, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we\r\nwanted for ourselves.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.\r\nYou will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to\r\nthis floor.\" He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in\r\nhis hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining\r\nminutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with\r\nthe wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he\r\nwalked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and\r\nin running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the\r\nbell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's a dummy,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Won't it ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.\r\nYou can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where\r\nthe little opening for the ventilator is.\"\r\n\r\n\"How very absurd! I never noticed that before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very strange!\" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. \"There are\r\none or two very singular points about this room. For example,\r\nwhat a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another\r\nroom, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated\r\nwith the outside air!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is also quite modern,\" said the lady.\r\n\r\n\"Done about the same time as the bell-rope?\" remarked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy\r\nbell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your\r\npermission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into\r\nthe inner apartment.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his\r\nstep-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small\r\nwooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an\r\narmchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a\r\nround table, and a large iron safe were the principal things\r\nwhich met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each\r\nand all of them with the keenest interest.\r\n\r\n\"What's in here?\" he asked, tapping the safe.\r\n\r\n\"My stepfather's business papers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you have seen inside, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of\r\npapers.\"\r\n\r\n\"There isn't a cat in it, for example?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. What a strange idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look at this!\" He took up a small saucer of milk which\r\nstood on the top of it.\r\n\r\n\"No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a\r\nsaucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I\r\ndaresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine.\" He\r\nsquatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat\r\nof it with the greatest attention.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. That is quite settled,\" said he, rising and putting\r\nhis lens in his pocket. \"Hullo! Here is something interesting!\"\r\n\r\nThe object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on\r\none corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself\r\nand tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.\r\n\r\n\"What do you make of that, Watson?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be\r\ntied.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,\r\nand when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst\r\nof all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and\r\nwith your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn.\"\r\n\r\nI had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as\r\nit was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We\r\nhad walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss\r\nStoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he\r\nroused himself from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\"It is very essential, Miss Stoner,\" said he, \"that you should\r\nabsolutely follow my advice in every respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall most certainly do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may\r\ndepend upon your compliance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I assure you that I am in your hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in\r\nyour room.\"\r\n\r\nBoth Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the\r\nvillage inn over there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that is the Crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a\r\nheadache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him\r\nretire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,\r\nundo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then\r\nwithdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want\r\ninto the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in\r\nspite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"The rest you will leave in our hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate\r\nthe cause of this noise which has disturbed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,\"\r\nsaid Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's\r\ndeath.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and\r\nif she died from some sudden fright.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more\r\ntangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if\r\nDr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.\r\nGood-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,\r\nyou may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers\r\nthat threaten you.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and\r\nsitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and\r\nfrom our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and\r\nof the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw\r\nDr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside\r\nthe little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some\r\nslight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard\r\nthe hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which\r\nhe shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few\r\nminutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as\r\nthe lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know, Watson,\" said Holmes as we sat together in the\r\ngathering darkness, \"I have really some scruples as to taking you\r\nto-night. There is a distinct element of danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I be of assistance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your presence might be invaluable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I shall certainly come.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very kind of you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms\r\nthan was visible to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine\r\nthat you saw all that I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose\r\nthat could answer I confess is more than I can imagine.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw the ventilator, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to\r\nhave a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a\r\nrat could hardly pass through.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to\r\nStoke Moran.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her\r\nsister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that\r\nsuggested at once that there must be a communication between the\r\ntwo rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been\r\nremarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what harm can there be in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A\r\nventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the\r\nbed dies. Does not that strike you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot as yet see any connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened\r\nlike that before?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say that I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same\r\nrelative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may\r\ncall it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull.\"\r\n\r\n\"Holmes,\" I cried, \"I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.\r\nWe are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong\r\nhe is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.\r\nPalmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.\r\nThis man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall\r\nbe able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough\r\nbefore the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet\r\npipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more\r\ncheerful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,\r\nand all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours\r\npassed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of\r\neleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.\r\n\r\n\"That is our signal,\" said Holmes, springing to his feet; \"it\r\ncomes from the middle window.\"\r\n\r\nAs we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,\r\nexplaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,\r\nand that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A\r\nmoment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing\r\nin our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us\r\nthrough the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.\r\n\r\nThere was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for\r\nunrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way\r\namong the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about\r\nto enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel\r\nbushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted\r\nchild, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and\r\nthen ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" I whispered; \"did you see it?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like\r\na vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low\r\nlaugh and put his lips to my ear.\r\n\r\n\"It is a nice household,\" he murmured. \"That is the baboon.\"\r\n\r\nI had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There\r\nwas a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders\r\nat any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,\r\nafter following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I\r\nfound myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed\r\nthe shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes\r\nround the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then\r\ncreeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered\r\ninto my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to\r\ndistinguish the words:\r\n\r\n\"The least sound would be fatal to our plans.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded to show that I had heard.\r\n\r\n\"We must sit without light. He would see it through the\r\nventilator.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded again.\r\n\r\n\"Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your\r\npistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of\r\nthe bed, and you in that chair.\"\r\n\r\nI took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.\r\n\r\nHolmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon\r\nthe bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the\r\nstump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left\r\nin darkness.\r\n\r\nHow shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a\r\nsound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my\r\ncompanion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same\r\nstate of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut\r\noff the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nFrom outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at\r\nour very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that\r\nthe cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the\r\ndeep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of\r\nan hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and\r\none and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for\r\nwhatever might befall.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the\r\ndirection of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was\r\nsucceeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.\r\nSomeone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle\r\nsound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the\r\nsmell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.\r\nThen suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,\r\nsoothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping\r\ncontinually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes\r\nsprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with\r\nhis cane at the bell-pull.\r\n\r\n\"You see it, Watson?\" he yelled. \"You see it?\"\r\n\r\nBut I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I\r\nheard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my\r\nweary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which\r\nmy friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face\r\nwas deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had\r\nceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when\r\nsuddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most\r\nhorrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder\r\nand louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled\r\nin the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the\r\nvillage, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the\r\nsleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I\r\nstood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it\r\nhad died away into the silence from which it rose.\r\n\r\n\"What can it mean?\" I gasped.\r\n\r\n\"It means that it is all over,\" Holmes answered. \"And perhaps,\r\nafter all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will\r\nenter Dr. Roylott's room.\"\r\n\r\nWith a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the\r\ncorridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply\r\nfrom within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his\r\nheels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.\r\n\r\nIt was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a\r\ndark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant\r\nbeam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.\r\nBeside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott\r\nclad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding\r\nbeneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.\r\nAcross his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we\r\nhad noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his\r\neyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the\r\nceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with\r\nbrownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his\r\nhead. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.\r\n\r\n\"The band! the speckled band!\" whispered Holmes.\r\n\r\nI took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began\r\nto move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat\r\ndiamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.\r\n\r\n\"It is a swamp adder!\" cried Holmes; \"the deadliest snake in\r\nIndia. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence\r\ndoes, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls\r\ninto the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this\r\ncreature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to\r\nsome place of shelter and let the county police know what has\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,\r\nand throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from\r\nits horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into\r\nthe iron safe, which he closed upon it.\r\n\r\nSuch are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of\r\nStoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a\r\nnarrative which has already run to too great a length by telling\r\nhow we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed\r\nher by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,\r\nof how the slow process of official inquiry came to the\r\nconclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly\r\nplaying with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn\r\nof the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back\r\nnext day.\r\n\r\n\"I had,\" said he, \"come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which\r\nshows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from\r\ninsufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of\r\nthe word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to\r\nexplain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of\r\nby the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an\r\nentirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly\r\nreconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me\r\nthat whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not\r\ncome either from the window or the door. My attention was\r\nspeedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this\r\nventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The\r\ndiscovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to\r\nthe floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was\r\nthere as a bridge for something passing through the hole and\r\ncoming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,\r\nand when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was\r\nfurnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I\r\nwas probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of\r\npoison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical\r\ntest was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless\r\nman who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such\r\na poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be\r\nan advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could\r\ndistinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where\r\nthe poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the\r\nwhistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning\r\nlight revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by\r\nthe use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.\r\nHe would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he\r\nthought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the\r\nrope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the\r\noccupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but\r\nsooner or later she must fall a victim.\r\n\r\n\"I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his\r\nroom. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in\r\nthe habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary\r\nin order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the\r\nsafe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to\r\nfinally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic\r\nclang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather\r\nhastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.\r\nHaving once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in\r\norder to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss\r\nas I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the\r\nlight and attacked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the result of driving it through the ventilator.\"\r\n\r\n\"And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master\r\nat the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and\r\nroused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person\r\nit saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.\r\nGrimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to\r\nweigh very heavily upon my conscience.\"\r\n", "The Adventure of the Cardboard Box": "      In choosing a few typical cases which illustrate the remarkable\r\n      mental qualities of my friend, Sherlock Holmes, I have\r\n      endeavoured, as far as possible, to select those which presented\r\n      the minimum of sensationalism, while offering a fair field for\r\n      his talents. It is, however, unfortunately impossible entirely to\r\n      separate the sensational from the criminal, and a chronicler is\r\n      left in the dilemma that he must either sacrifice details which\r\n      are essential to his statement and so give a false impression of\r\n      the problem, or he must use matter which chance, and not choice,\r\n      has provided him with. With this short preface I shall turn to my\r\n      notes of what proved to be a strange, though a peculiarly\r\n      terrible, chain of events.\r\n\r\n      It was a blazing hot day in August. Baker Street was like an\r\n      oven, and the glare of the sunlight upon the yellow brickwork of\r\n      the house across the road was painful to the eye. It was hard to\r\n      believe that these were the same walls which loomed so gloomily\r\n      through the fogs of winter. Our blinds were half-drawn, and\r\n      Holmes lay curled upon the sofa, reading and re-reading a letter\r\n      which he had received by the morning post. For myself, my term of\r\n      service in India had trained me to stand heat better than cold,\r\n      and a thermometer at ninety was no hardship. But the morning\r\n      paper was uninteresting. Parliament had risen. Everybody was out\r\n      of town, and I yearned for the glades of the New Forest or the\r\n      shingle of Southsea. A depleted bank account had caused me to\r\n      postpone my holiday, and as to my companion, neither the country\r\n      nor the sea presented the slightest attraction to him. He loved\r\n      to lie in the very centre of five millions of people, with his\r\n      filaments stretching out and running through them, responsive to\r\n      every little rumour or suspicion of unsolved crime. Appreciation\r\n      of nature found no place among his many gifts, and his only\r\n      change was when he turned his mind from the evil-doer of the town\r\n      to track down his brother of the country.\r\n\r\n      Finding that Holmes was too absorbed for conversation I had\r\n      tossed aside the barren paper, and leaning back in my chair I\r\n      fell into a brown study. Suddenly my companion\u2019s voice broke in\r\n      upon my thoughts:\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are right, Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cIt does seem a most\r\n      preposterous way of settling a dispute.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMost preposterous!\u201d I exclaimed, and then suddenly realizing how\r\n      he had echoed the inmost thought of my soul, I sat up in my chair\r\n      and stared at him in blank amazement.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is this, Holmes?\u201d I cried. \u201cThis is beyond anything which I\r\n      could have imagined.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He laughed heartily at my perplexity.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou remember,\u201d he said, \u201cthat some little time ago when I read\r\n      you the passage in one of Poe\u2019s sketches in which a close\r\n      reasoner follows the unspoken thoughts of his companion, you were\r\n      inclined to treat the matter as a mere _tour-de-force_ of the\r\n      author. On my remarking that I was constantly in the habit of\r\n      doing the same thing you expressed incredulity.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, no!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps not with your tongue, my dear Watson, but certainly with\r\n      your eyebrows. So when I saw you throw down your paper and enter\r\n      upon a train of thought, I was very happy to have the opportunity\r\n      of reading it off, and eventually of breaking into it, as a proof\r\n      that I had been in rapport with you.\u201d\r\n\r\n      But I was still far from satisfied. \u201cIn the example which you\r\n      read to me,\u201d said I, \u201cthe reasoner drew his conclusions from the\r\n      actions of the man whom he observed. If I remember right, he\r\n      stumbled over a heap of stones, looked up at the stars, and so\r\n      on. But I have been seated quietly in my chair, and what clues\r\n      can I have given you?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou do yourself an injustice. The features are given to man as\r\n      the means by which he shall express his emotions, and yours are\r\n      faithful servants.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDo you mean to say that you read my train of thoughts from my\r\n      features?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour features and especially your eyes. Perhaps you cannot\r\n      yourself recall how your reverie commenced?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I cannot.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen I will tell you. After throwing down your paper, which was\r\n      the action which drew my attention to you, you sat for half a\r\n      minute with a vacant expression. Then your eyes fixed themselves\r\n      upon your newly framed picture of General Gordon, and I saw by\r\n      the alteration in your face that a train of thought had been\r\n      started. But it did not lead very far. Your eyes flashed across\r\n      to the unframed portrait of Henry Ward Beecher which stands upon\r\n      the top of your books. Then you glanced up at the wall, and of\r\n      course your meaning was obvious. You were thinking that if the\r\n      portrait were framed it would just cover that bare space and\r\n      correspond with Gordon\u2019s picture over there.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have followed me wonderfully!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo far I could hardly have gone astray. But now your thoughts\r\n      went back to Beecher, and you looked hard across as if you were\r\n      studying the character in his features. Then your eyes ceased to\r\n      pucker, but you continued to look across, and your face was\r\n      thoughtful. You were recalling the incidents of Beecher\u2019s career.\r\n      I was well aware that you could not do this without thinking of\r\n      the mission which he undertook on behalf of the North at the time\r\n      of the Civil War, for I remember your expressing your passionate\r\n      indignation at the way in which he was received by the more\r\n      turbulent of our people. You felt so strongly about it that I\r\n      knew you could not think of Beecher without thinking of that\r\n      also. When a moment later I saw your eyes wander away from the\r\n      picture, I suspected that your mind had now turned to the Civil\r\n      War, and when I observed that your lips set, your eyes sparkled,\r\n      and your hands clenched I was positive that you were indeed\r\n      thinking of the gallantry which was shown by both sides in that\r\n      desperate struggle. But then, again, your face grew sadder; you\r\n      shook your head. You were dwelling upon the sadness and horror\r\n      and useless waste of life. Your hand stole towards your own old\r\n      wound and a smile quivered on your lips, which showed me that the\r\n      ridiculous side of this method of settling international\r\n      questions had forced itself upon your mind. At this point I\r\n      agreed with you that it was preposterous and was glad to find\r\n      that all my deductions had been correct.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbsolutely!\u201d said I. \u201cAnd now that you have explained it, I\r\n      confess that I am as amazed as before.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was very superficial, my dear Watson, I assure you. I should\r\n      not have intruded it upon your attention had you not shown some\r\n      incredulity the other day. But I have in my hands here a little\r\n      problem which may prove to be more difficult of solution than my\r\n      small essay in thought reading. Have you observed in the paper a\r\n      short paragraph referring to the remarkable contents of a packet\r\n      sent through the post to Miss Cushing, of Cross Street, Croydon?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, I saw nothing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! then you must have overlooked it. Just toss it over to me.\r\n      Here it is, under the financial column. Perhaps you would be good\r\n      enough to read it aloud.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I picked up the paper which he had thrown back to me and read the\r\n      paragraph indicated. It was headed, \u201cA Gruesome Packet.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cMiss Susan Cushing, living at Cross Street, Croydon, has been\r\n      made the victim of what must be regarded as a peculiarly\r\n      revolting practical joke unless some more sinister meaning should\r\n      prove to be attached to the incident. At two o\u2019clock yesterday\r\n      afternoon a small packet, wrapped in brown paper, was handed in\r\n      by the postman. A cardboard box was inside, which was filled with\r\n      coarse salt. On emptying this, Miss Cushing was horrified to find\r\n      two human ears, apparently quite freshly severed. The box had\r\n      been sent by parcel post from Belfast upon the morning before.\r\n      There is no indication as to the sender, and the matter is the\r\n      more mysterious as Miss Cushing, who is a maiden lady of fifty,\r\n      has led a most retired life, and has so few acquaintances or\r\n      correspondents that it is a rare event for her to receive\r\n      anything through the post. Some years ago, however, when she\r\n      resided at Penge, she let apartments in her house to three young\r\n      medical students, whom she was obliged to get rid of on account\r\n      of their noisy and irregular habits. The police are of opinion\r\n      that this outrage may have been perpetrated upon Miss Cushing by\r\n      these youths, who owed her a grudge and who hoped to frighten her\r\n      by sending her these relics of the dissecting-rooms. Some\r\n      probability is lent to the theory by the fact that one of these\r\n      students came from the north of Ireland, and, to the best of Miss\r\n      Cushing\u2019s belief, from Belfast. In the meantime, the matter is\r\n      being actively investigated, Mr. Lestrade, one of the very\r\n      smartest of our detective officers, being in charge of the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much for the _Daily Chronicle_,\u201d said Holmes as I finished\r\n      reading. \u201cNow for our friend Lestrade. I had a note from him this\r\n      morning, in which he says: \u2018I think that this case is very much\r\n      in your line. We have every hope of clearing the matter up, but\r\n      we find a little difficulty in getting anything to work upon. We\r\n      have, of course, wired to the Belfast post-office, but a large\r\n      number of parcels were handed in upon that day, and they have no\r\n      means of identifying this particular one, or of remembering the\r\n      sender. The box is a half-pound box of honeydew tobacco and does\r\n      not help us in any way. The medical student theory still appears\r\n      to me to be the most feasible, but if you should have a few hours\r\n      to spare I should be very happy to see you out here. I shall be\r\n      either at the house or in the police-station all day.\u2019 What say\r\n      you, Watson? Can you rise superior to the heat and run down to\r\n      Croydon with me on the off chance of a case for your annals?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was longing for something to do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou shall have it then. Ring for our boots and tell them to\r\n      order a cab. I\u2019ll be back in a moment when I have changed my\r\n      dressing-gown and filled my cigar-case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A shower of rain fell while we were in the train, and the heat\r\n      was far less oppressive in Croydon than in town. Holmes had sent\r\n      on a wire, so that Lestrade, as wiry, as dapper, and as\r\n      ferret-like as ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of\r\n      five minutes took us to Cross Street, where Miss Cushing resided.\r\n\r\n      It was a very long street of two-story brick houses, neat and\r\n      prim, with whitened stone steps and little groups of aproned\r\n      women gossiping at the doors. Halfway down, Lestrade stopped and\r\n      tapped at a door, which was opened by a small servant girl. Miss\r\n      Cushing was sitting in the front room, into which we were\r\n      ushered. She was a placid-faced woman, with large, gentle eyes,\r\n      and grizzled hair curving down over her temples on each side. A\r\n      worked antimacassar lay upon her lap and a basket of coloured\r\n      silks stood upon a stool beside her.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThey are in the outhouse, those dreadful things,\u201d said she as\r\n      Lestrade entered. \u201cI wish that you would take them away\r\n      altogether.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo I shall, Miss Cushing. I only kept them here until my friend,\r\n      Mr. Holmes, should have seen them in your presence.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhy in my presence, sir?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn case he wished to ask any questions.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is the use of asking me questions when I tell you I know\r\n      nothing whatever about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cQuite so, madam,\u201d said Holmes in his soothing way. \u201cI have no\r\n      doubt that you have been annoyed more than enough already over\r\n      this business.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIndeed, I have, sir. I am a quiet woman and live a retired life.\r\n      It is something new for me to see my name in the papers and to\r\n      find the police in my house. I won\u2019t have those things in here,\r\n      Mr. Lestrade. If you wish to see them you must go to the\r\n      outhouse.\u201d\r\n\r\n      It was a small shed in the narrow garden which ran behind the\r\n      house. Lestrade went in and brought out a yellow cardboard box,\r\n      with a piece of brown paper and some string. There was a bench at\r\n      the end of the path, and we all sat down while Holmes examined,\r\n      one by one, the articles which Lestrade had handed to him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe string is exceedingly interesting,\u201d he remarked, holding it\r\n      up to the light and sniffing at it. \u201cWhat do you make of this\r\n      string, Lestrade?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has been tarred.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely. It is a piece of tarred twine. You have also, no\r\n      doubt, remarked that Miss Cushing has cut the cord with a\r\n      scissors, as can be seen by the double fray on each side. This is\r\n      of importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI cannot see the importance,\u201d said Lestrade.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe importance lies in the fact that the knot is left intact,\r\n      and that this knot is of a peculiar character.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is very neatly tied. I had already made a note to that\r\n      effect,\u201d said Lestrade complacently.\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much for the string, then,\u201d said Holmes, smiling, \u201cnow for\r\n      the box wrapper. Brown paper, with a distinct smell of coffee.\r\n      What, did you not observe it? I think there can be no doubt of\r\n      it. Address printed in rather straggling characters: \u2018Miss S.\r\n      Cushing, Cross Street, Croydon.\u2019 Done with a broad-pointed pen,\r\n      probably a J, and with very inferior ink. The word \u2018Croydon\u2019 has\r\n      been originally spelled with an \u2018i,\u2019 which has been changed to\r\n      \u2018y.\u2019 The parcel was directed, then, by a man\u2014the printing is\r\n      distinctly masculine\u2014of limited education and unacquainted with\r\n      the town of Croydon. So far, so good! The box is a yellow\r\n      half-pound honeydew box, with nothing distinctive save two thumb\r\n      marks at the left bottom corner. It is filled with rough salt of\r\n      the quality used for preserving hides and other of the coarser\r\n      commercial purposes. And embedded in it are these very singular\r\n      enclosures.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He took out the two ears as he spoke, and laying a board across\r\n      his knee he examined them minutely, while Lestrade and I, bending\r\n      forward on each side of him, glanced alternately at these\r\n      dreadful relics and at the thoughtful, eager face of our\r\n      companion. Finally he returned them to the box once more and sat\r\n      for a while in deep meditation.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have observed, of course,\u201d said he at last, \u201cthat the ears\r\n      are not a pair.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, I have noticed that. But if this were the practical joke of\r\n      some students from the dissecting-rooms, it would be as easy for\r\n      them to send two odd ears as a pair.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely. But this is not a practical joke.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are sure of it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe presumption is strongly against it. Bodies in the\r\n      dissecting-rooms are injected with preservative fluid. These ears\r\n      bear no signs of this. They are fresh, too. They have been cut\r\n      off with a blunt instrument, which would hardly happen if a\r\n      student had done it. Again, carbolic or rectified spirits would\r\n      be the preservatives which would suggest themselves to the\r\n      medical mind, certainly not rough salt. I repeat that there is no\r\n      practical joke here, but that we are investigating a serious\r\n      crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A vague thrill ran through me as I listened to my companion\u2019s\r\n      words and saw the stern gravity which had hardened his features.\r\n      This brutal preliminary seemed to shadow forth some strange and\r\n      inexplicable horror in the background. Lestrade, however, shook\r\n      his head like a man who is only half convinced.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are objections to the joke theory, no doubt,\u201d said he,\r\n      \u201cbut there are much stronger reasons against the other. We know\r\n      that this woman has led a most quiet and respectable life at\r\n      Penge and here for the last twenty years. She has hardly been\r\n      away from her home for a day during that time. Why on earth,\r\n      then, should any criminal send her the proofs of his guilt,\r\n      especially as, unless she is a most consummate actress, she\r\n      understands quite as little of the matter as we do?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is the problem which we have to solve,\u201d Holmes answered,\r\n      \u201cand for my part I shall set about it by presuming that my\r\n      reasoning is correct, and that a double murder has been\r\n      committed. One of these ears is a woman\u2019s, small, finely formed,\r\n      and pierced for an earring. The other is a man\u2019s, sun-burned,\r\n      discoloured, and also pierced for an earring. These two people\r\n      are presumably dead, or we should have heard their story before\r\n      now. To-day is Friday. The packet was posted on Thursday morning.\r\n      The tragedy, then, occurred on Wednesday or Tuesday or earlier.\r\n      If the two people were murdered, who but their murderer would\r\n      have sent this sign of his work to Miss Cushing? We may take it\r\n      that the sender of the packet is the man whom we want. But he\r\n      must have some strong reason for sending Miss Cushing this\r\n      packet. What reason then? It must have been to tell her that the\r\n      deed was done! or to pain her, perhaps. But in that case she\r\n      knows who it is. Does she know? I doubt it. If she knew, why\r\n      should she call the police in? She might have buried the ears,\r\n      and no one would have been the wiser. That is what she would have\r\n      done if she had wished to shield the criminal. But if she does\r\n      not wish to shield him she would give his name. There is a tangle\r\n      here which needs straightening out.\u201d He had been talking in a\r\n      high, quick voice, staring blankly up over the garden fence, but\r\n      now he sprang briskly to his feet and walked towards the house.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have a few questions to ask Miss Cushing,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn that case I may leave you here,\u201d said Lestrade, \u201cfor I have\r\n      another small business on hand. I think that I have nothing\r\n      further to learn from Miss Cushing. You will find me at the\r\n      police-station.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe shall look in on our way to the train,\u201d answered Holmes. A\r\n      moment later he and I were back in the front room, where the\r\n      impassive lady was still quietly working away at her\r\n      antimacassar. She put it down on her lap as we entered and looked\r\n      at us with her frank, searching blue eyes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am convinced, sir,\u201d she said, \u201cthat this matter is a mistake,\r\n      and that the parcel was never meant for me at all. I have said\r\n      this several times to the gentleman from Scotland Yard, but he\r\n      simply laughs at me. I have not an enemy in the world, as far as\r\n      I know, so why should anyone play me such a trick?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am coming to be of the same opinion, Miss Cushing,\u201d said\r\n      Holmes, taking a seat beside her. \u201cI think that it is more than\r\n      probable\u2014\u2014\u201d he paused, and I was surprised, on glancing round to\r\n      see that he was staring with singular intentness at the lady\u2019s\r\n      profile. Surprise and satisfaction were both for an instant to be\r\n      read upon his eager face, though when she glanced round to find\r\n      out the cause of his silence he had become as demure as ever. I\r\n      stared hard myself at her flat, grizzled hair, her trim cap, her\r\n      little gilt earrings, her placid features; but I could see\r\n      nothing which could account for my companion\u2019s evident\r\n      excitement.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere were one or two questions\u2014\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, I am weary of questions!\u201d cried Miss Cushing impatiently.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have two sisters, I believe.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow could you know that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI observed the very instant that I entered the room that you\r\n      have a portrait group of three ladies upon the mantelpiece, one\r\n      of whom is undoubtedly yourself, while the others are so\r\n      exceedingly like you that there could be no doubt of the\r\n      relationship.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, you are quite right. Those are my sisters, Sarah and Mary.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd here at my elbow is another portrait, taken at Liverpool, of\r\n      your younger sister, in the company of a man who appears to be a\r\n      steward by his uniform. I observe that she was unmarried at the\r\n      time.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are very quick at observing.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is my trade.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, you are quite right. But she was married to Mr. Browner a\r\n      few days afterwards. He was on the South American line when that\r\n      was taken, but he was so fond of her that he couldn\u2019t abide to\r\n      leave her for so long, and he got into the Liverpool and London\r\n      boats.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, the _Conqueror_, perhaps?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo, the _May Day_, when last I heard. Jim came down here to see\r\n      me once. That was before he broke the pledge; but afterwards he\r\n      would always take drink when he was ashore, and a little drink\r\n      would send him stark, staring mad. Ah! it was a bad day that ever\r\n      he took a glass in his hand again. First he dropped me, then he\r\n      quarrelled with Sarah, and now that Mary has stopped writing we\r\n      don\u2019t know how things are going with them.\u201d\r\n\r\n      It was evident that Miss Cushing had come upon a subject on which\r\n      she felt very deeply. Like most people who lead a lonely life,\r\n      she was shy at first, but ended by becoming extremely\r\n      communicative. She told us many details about her brother-in-law\r\n      the steward, and then wandering off on the subject of her former\r\n      lodgers, the medical students, she gave us a long account of\r\n      their delinquencies, with their names and those of their\r\n      hospitals. Holmes listened attentively to everything, throwing in\r\n      a question from time to time.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbout your second sister, Sarah,\u201d said he. \u201cI wonder, since you\r\n      are both maiden ladies, that you do not keep house together.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh! you don\u2019t know Sarah\u2019s temper or you would wonder no more. I\r\n      tried it when I came to Croydon, and we kept on until about two\r\n      months ago, when we had to part. I don\u2019t want to say a word\r\n      against my own sister, but she was always meddlesome and hard to\r\n      please, was Sarah.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou say that she quarrelled with your Liverpool relations.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, and they were the best of friends at one time. Why, she\r\n      went up there to live in order to be near them. And now she has\r\n      no word hard enough for Jim Browner. The last six months that she\r\n      was here she would speak of nothing but his drinking and his\r\n      ways. He had caught her meddling, I suspect, and given her a bit\r\n      of his mind, and that was the start of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you, Miss Cushing,\u201d said Holmes, rising and bowing. \u201cYour\r\n      sister Sarah lives, I think you said, at New Street Wallington?\r\n      Good-bye, and I am very sorry that you should have been troubled\r\n      over a case with which, as you say, you have nothing whatever to\r\n      do.\u201d\r\n\r\n      There was a cab passing as we came out, and Holmes hailed it.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow far to Wallington?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOnly about a mile, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery good. Jump in, Watson. We must strike while the iron is\r\n      hot. Simple as the case is, there have been one or two very\r\n      instructive details in connection with it. Just pull up at a\r\n      telegraph office as you pass, cabby.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes sent off a short wire and for the rest of the drive lay\r\n      back in the cab, with his hat tilted over his nose to keep the\r\n      sun from his face. Our driver pulled up at a house which was not\r\n      unlike the one which we had just quitted. My companion ordered\r\n      him to wait, and had his hand upon the knocker, when the door\r\n      opened and a grave young gentleman in black, with a very shiny\r\n      hat, appeared on the step.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIs Miss Cushing at home?\u201d asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMiss Sarah Cushing is extremely ill,\u201d said he. \u201cShe has been\r\n      suffering since yesterday from brain symptoms of great severity.\r\n      As her medical adviser, I cannot possibly take the responsibility\r\n      of allowing anyone to see her. I should recommend you to call\r\n      again in ten days.\u201d He drew on his gloves, closed the door, and\r\n      marched off down the street.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, if we can\u2019t we can\u2019t,\u201d said Holmes, cheerfully.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPerhaps she could not or would not have told you much.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI did not wish her to tell me anything. I only wanted to look at\r\n      her. However, I think that I have got all that I want. Drive us\r\n      to some decent hotel, cabby, where we may have some lunch, and\r\n      afterwards we shall drop down upon friend Lestrade at the\r\n      police-station.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We had a pleasant little meal together, during which Holmes would\r\n      talk about nothing but violins, narrating with great exultation\r\n      how he had purchased his own Stradivarius, which was worth at\r\n      least five hundred guineas, at a Jew broker\u2019s in Tottenham Court\r\n      Road for fifty-five shillings. This led him to Paganini, and we\r\n      sat for an hour over a bottle of claret while he told me anecdote\r\n      after anecdote of that extraordinary man. The afternoon was far\r\n      advanced and the hot glare had softened into a mellow glow before\r\n      we found ourselves at the police-station. Lestrade was waiting\r\n      for us at the door.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA telegram for you, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHa! It is the answer!\u201d He tore it open, glanced his eyes over\r\n      it, and crumpled it into his pocket. \u201cThat\u2019s all right,\u201d said he.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you found out anything?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have found out everything!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat!\u201d Lestrade stared at him in amazement. \u201cYou are joking.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was never more serious in my life. A shocking crime has been\r\n      committed, and I think I have now laid bare every detail of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the criminal?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes scribbled a few words upon the back of one of his visiting\r\n      cards and threw it over to Lestrade.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat is the name,\u201d he said. \u201cYou cannot effect an arrest until\r\n      to-morrow night at the earliest. I should prefer that you do not\r\n      mention my name at all in connection with the case, as I choose\r\n      to be only associated with those crimes which present some\r\n      difficulty in their solution. Come on, Watson.\u201d We strode off\r\n      together to the station, leaving Lestrade still staring with a\r\n      delighted face at the card which Holmes had thrown him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe case,\u201d said Sherlock Holmes as we chatted over our cigars\r\n      that night in our rooms at Baker Street, \u201cis one where, as in the\r\n      investigations which you have chronicled under the names of \u2018A\r\n      Study in Scarlet\u2019 and of \u2018The Sign of Four,\u2019 we have been\r\n      compelled to reason backward from effects to causes. I have\r\n      written to Lestrade asking him to supply us with the details\r\n      which are now wanting, and which he will only get after he has\r\n      secured his man. That he may be safely trusted to do, for\r\n      although he is absolutely devoid of reason, he is as tenacious as\r\n      a bulldog when he once understands what he has to do, and,\r\n      indeed, it is just this tenacity which has brought him to the top\r\n      at Scotland Yard.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour case is not complete, then?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is fairly complete in essentials. We know who the author of\r\n      the revolting business is, although one of the victims still\r\n      escapes us. Of course, you have formed your own conclusions.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI presume that this Jim Browner, the steward of a Liverpool\r\n      boat, is the man whom you suspect?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh! it is more than a suspicion.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd yet I cannot see anything save very vague indications.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary, to my mind nothing could be more clear. Let me\r\n      run over the principal steps. We approached the case, you\r\n      remember, with an absolutely blank mind, which is always an\r\n      advantage. We had formed no theories. We were simply there to\r\n      observe and to draw inferences from our observations. What did we\r\n      see first? A very placid and respectable lady, who seemed quite\r\n      innocent of any secret, and a portrait which showed me that she\r\n      had two younger sisters. It instantly flashed across my mind that\r\n      the box might have been meant for one of these. I set the idea\r\n      aside as one which could be disproved or confirmed at our\r\n      leisure. Then we went to the garden, as you remember, and we saw\r\n      the very singular contents of the little yellow box.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe string was of the quality which is used by sailmakers aboard\r\n      ship, and at once a whiff of the sea was perceptible in our\r\n      investigation. When I observed that the knot was one which is\r\n      popular with sailors, that the parcel had been posted at a port,\r\n      and that the male ear was pierced for an earring which is so much\r\n      more common among sailors than landsmen, I was quite certain that\r\n      all the actors in the tragedy were to be found among our\r\n      seafaring classes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I came to examine the address of the packet I observed that\r\n      it was to Miss S. Cushing. Now, the oldest sister would, of\r\n      course, be Miss Cushing, and although her initial was \u2018S\u2019 it\r\n      might belong to one of the others as well. In that case we should\r\n      have to commence our investigation from a fresh basis altogether.\r\n      I therefore went into the house with the intention of clearing up\r\n      this point. I was about to assure Miss Cushing that I was\r\n      convinced that a mistake had been made when you may remember that\r\n      I came suddenly to a stop. The fact was that I had just seen\r\n      something which filled me with surprise and at the same time\r\n      narrowed the field of our inquiry immensely.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAs a medical man, you are aware, Watson, that there is no part\r\n      of the body which varies so much as the human ear. Each ear is as\r\n      a rule quite distinctive and differs from all other ones. In last\r\n      year\u2019s _Anthropological Journal_ you will find two short\r\n      monographs from my pen upon the subject. I had, therefore,\r\n      examined the ears in the box with the eyes of an expert and had\r\n      carefully noted their anatomical peculiarities. Imagine my\r\n      surprise, then, when on looking at Miss Cushing I perceived that\r\n      her ear corresponded exactly with the female ear which I had just\r\n      inspected. The matter was entirely beyond coincidence. There was\r\n      the same shortening of the pinna, the same broad curve of the\r\n      upper lobe, the same convolution of the inner cartilage. In all\r\n      essentials it was the same ear.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course I at once saw the enormous importance of the\r\n      observation. It was evident that the victim was a blood relation\r\n      and probably a very close one. I began to talk to her about her\r\n      family, and you remember that she at once gave us some\r\n      exceedingly valuable details.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the first place, her sister\u2019s name was Sarah, and her address\r\n      had until recently been the same, so that it was quite obvious\r\n      how the mistake had occurred and for whom the packet was meant.\r\n      Then we heard of this steward, married to the third sister, and\r\n      learned that he had at one time been so intimate with Miss Sarah\r\n      that she had actually gone up to Liverpool to be near the\r\n      Browners, but a quarrel had afterwards divided them. This quarrel\r\n      had put a stop to all communications for some months, so that if\r\n      Browner had occasion to address a packet to Miss Sarah, he would\r\n      undoubtedly have done so to her old address.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now the matter had begun to straighten itself out\r\n      wonderfully. We had learned of the existence of this steward, an\r\n      impulsive man, of strong passions\u2014you remember that he threw up\r\n      what must have been a very superior berth in order to be nearer\r\n      to his wife\u2014subject, too, to occasional fits of hard drinking. We\r\n      had reason to believe that his wife had been murdered, and that a\r\n      man\u2014presumably a seafaring man\u2014had been murdered at the same\r\n      time. Jealousy, of course, at once suggests itself as the motive\r\n      for the crime. And why should these proofs of the deed be sent to\r\n      Miss Sarah Cushing? Probably because during her residence in\r\n      Liverpool she had some hand in bringing about the events which\r\n      led to the tragedy. You will observe that this line of boats\r\n      calls at Belfast, Dublin, and Waterford; so that, presuming that\r\n      Browner had committed the deed and had embarked at once upon his\r\n      steamer, the _May Day_, Belfast would be the first place at which\r\n      he could post his terrible packet.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA second solution was at this stage obviously possible, and\r\n      although I thought it exceedingly unlikely, I was determined to\r\n      elucidate it before going further. An unsuccessful lover might\r\n      have killed Mr. and Mrs. Browner, and the male ear might have\r\n      belonged to the husband. There were many grave objections to this\r\n      theory, but it was conceivable. I therefore sent off a telegram\r\n      to my friend Algar, of the Liverpool force, and asked him to find\r\n      out if Mrs. Browner were at home, and if Browner had departed in\r\n      the _May Day_. Then we went on to Wallington to visit Miss Sarah.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was curious, in the first place, to see how far the family ear\r\n      had been reproduced in her. Then, of course, she might give us\r\n      very important information, but I was not sanguine that she\r\n      would. She must have heard of the business the day before, since\r\n      all Croydon was ringing with it, and she alone could have\r\n      understood for whom the packet was meant. If she had been willing\r\n      to help justice she would probably have communicated with the\r\n      police already. However, it was clearly our duty to see her, so\r\n      we went. We found that the news of the arrival of the packet\u2014for\r\n      her illness dated from that time\u2014had such an effect upon her as\r\n      to bring on brain fever. It was clearer than ever that she\r\n      understood its full significance, but equally clear that we\r\n      should have to wait some time for any assistance from her.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHowever, we were really independent of her help. Our answers\r\n      were waiting for us at the police-station, where I had directed\r\n      Algar to send them. Nothing could be more conclusive. Mrs.\r\n      Browner\u2019s house had been closed for more than three days, and the\r\n      neighbours were of opinion that she had gone south to see her\r\n      relatives. It had been ascertained at the shipping offices that\r\n      Browner had left aboard of the _May Day_, and I calculate that\r\n      she is due in the Thames to-morrow night. When he arrives he will\r\n      be met by the obtuse but resolute Lestrade, and I have no doubt\r\n      that we shall have all our details filled in.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes was not disappointed in his expectations. Two\r\n      days later he received a bulky envelope, which contained a short\r\n      note from the detective, and a typewritten document, which\r\n      covered several pages of foolscap.\r\n\r\n      \u201cLestrade has got him all right,\u201d said Holmes, glancing up at me.\r\n      \u201cPerhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear Mr. Holmes,\u2014In accordance with the scheme which we had\r\n      formed in order to test our theories\u201d\u2014\u201cthe \u2018we\u2019 is rather fine,\r\n      Watson, is it not?\u201d\u2014\u201cI went down to the Albert Dock yesterday at\r\n      6 P.M., and boarded the S.S. _May Day_, belonging to the\r\n      Liverpool, Dublin, and London Steam Packet Company. On inquiry, I\r\n      found that there was a steward on board of the name of James\r\n      Browner and that he had acted during the voyage in such an\r\n      extraordinary manner that the captain had been compelled to\r\n      relieve him of his duties. On descending to his berth, I found\r\n      him seated upon a chest with his head sunk upon his hands,\r\n      rocking himself to and fro. He is a big, powerful chap,\r\n      clean-shaven, and very swarthy\u2014 something like Aldridge, who\r\n      helped us in the bogus laundry affair. He jumped up when he heard\r\n      my business, and I had my whistle to my lips to call a couple of\r\n      river police, who were round the corner, but he seemed to have no\r\n      heart in him, and he held out his hands quietly enough for the\r\n      darbies. We brought him along to the cells, and his box as well,\r\n      for we thought there might be something incriminating; but, bar a\r\n      big sharp knife such as most sailors have, we got nothing for our\r\n      trouble. However, we find that we shall want no more evidence,\r\n      for on being brought before the inspector at the station he asked\r\n      leave to make a statement, which was, of course, taken down, just\r\n      as he made it, by our shorthand man. We had three copies\r\n      typewritten, one of which I enclose. The affair proves, as I\r\n      always thought it would, to be an extremely simple one, but I am\r\n      obliged to you for assisting me in my investigation. With kind\r\n      regards, yours very truly,\u2014G. Lestrade.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHum! The investigation really was a very simple one,\u201d remarked\r\n      Holmes, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think it struck him in that light when he\r\n      first called us in. However, let us see what Jim Browner has to\r\n      say for himself. This is his statement as made before Inspector\r\n      Montgomery at the Shadwell Police Station, and it has the\r\n      advantage of being verbatim.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave I anything to say? Yes, I have a deal to say. I have to\r\n      make a clean breast of it all. You can hang me, or you can leave\r\n      me alone. I don\u2019t care a plug which you do. I tell you I\u2019ve not\r\n      shut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don\u2019t believe I ever\r\n      will again until I get past all waking. Sometimes it\u2019s his face,\r\n      but most generally it\u2019s hers. I\u2019m never without one or the other\r\n      before me. He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind\r\n      o\u2019 surprise upon her face. Ay, the white lamb, she might well be\r\n      surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked\r\n      anything but love upon her before.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut it was Sarah\u2019s fault, and may the curse of a broken man put\r\n      a blight on her and set the blood rotting in her veins! It\u2019s not\r\n      that I want to clear myself. I know that I went back to drink,\r\n      like the beast that I was. But she would have forgiven me; she\r\n      would have stuck as close to me as a rope to a block if that\r\n      woman had never darkened our door. For Sarah Cushing loved\r\n      me\u2014that\u2019s the root of the business\u2014she loved me until all her\r\n      love turned to poisonous hate when she knew that I thought more\r\n      of my wife\u2019s footmark in the mud than I did of her whole body and\r\n      soul.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere were three sisters altogether. The old one was just a good\r\n      woman, the second was a devil, and the third was an angel. Sarah\r\n      was thirty-three, and Mary was twenty-nine when I married. We\r\n      were just as happy as the day was long when we set up house\r\n      together, and in all Liverpool there was no better woman than my\r\n      Mary. And then we asked Sarah up for a week, and the week grew\r\n      into a month, and one thing led to another, until she was just\r\n      one of ourselves.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was blue ribbon at that time, and we were putting a little\r\n      money by, and all was as bright as a new dollar. My God, whoever\r\n      would have thought that it could have come to this? Whoever would\r\n      have dreamed it?\r\n\r\n      \u201cI used to be home for the week-ends very often, and sometimes if\r\n      the ship were held back for cargo I would have a whole week at a\r\n      time, and in this way I saw a deal of my sister-in-law, Sarah.\r\n      She was a fine tall woman, black and quick and fierce, with a\r\n      proud way of carrying her head, and a glint from her eye like a\r\n      spark from a flint. But when little Mary was there I had never a\r\n      thought of her, and that I swear as I hope for God\u2019s mercy.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt had seemed to me sometimes that she liked to be alone with\r\n      me, or to coax me out for a walk with her, but I had never\r\n      thought anything of that. But one evening my eyes were opened. I\r\n      had come up from the ship and found my wife out, but Sarah at\r\n      home. \u2018Where\u2019s Mary?\u2019 I asked. \u2018Oh, she has gone to pay some\r\n      accounts.\u2019 I was impatient and paced up and down the room. \u2018Can\u2019t\r\n      you be happy for five minutes without Mary, Jim?\u2019 says she. \u2018It\u2019s\r\n      a bad compliment to me that you can\u2019t be contented with my\r\n      society for so short a time.\u2019 \u2018That\u2019s all right, my lass,\u2019 said\r\n      I, putting out my hand towards her in a kindly way, but she had\r\n      it in both hers in an instant, and they burned as if they were in\r\n      a fever. I looked into her eyes and I read it all there. There\r\n      was no need for her to speak, nor for me either. I frowned and\r\n      drew my hand away. Then she stood by my side in silence for a\r\n      bit, and then put up her hand and patted me on the shoulder.\r\n      \u2018Steady old Jim!\u2019 said she, and with a kind o\u2019 mocking laugh, she\r\n      ran out of the room.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, from that time Sarah hated me with her whole heart and\r\n      soul, and she is a woman who can hate, too. I was a fool to let\r\n      her go on biding with us\u2014a besotted fool\u2014but I never said a word\r\n      to Mary, for I knew it would grieve her. Things went on much as\r\n      before, but after a time I began to find that there was a bit of\r\n      a change in Mary herself. She had always been so trusting and so\r\n      innocent, but now she became queer and suspicious, wanting to\r\n      know where I had been and what I had been doing, and whom my\r\n      letters were from, and what I had in my pockets, and a thousand\r\n      such follies. Day by day she grew queerer and more irritable, and\r\n      we had ceaseless rows about nothing. I was fairly puzzled by it\r\n      all. Sarah avoided me now, but she and Mary were just\r\n      inseparable. I can see now how she was plotting and scheming and\r\n      poisoning my wife\u2019s mind against me, but I was such a blind\r\n      beetle that I could not understand it at the time. Then I broke\r\n      my blue ribbon and began to drink again, but I think I should not\r\n      have done it if Mary had been the same as ever. She had some\r\n      reason to be disgusted with me now, and the gap between us began\r\n      to be wider and wider. And then this Alec Fairbairn chipped in,\r\n      and things became a thousand times blacker.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was to see Sarah that he came to my house first, but soon it\r\n      was to see us, for he was a man with winning ways, and he made\r\n      friends wherever he went. He was a dashing, swaggering chap,\r\n      smart and curled, who had seen half the world and could talk of\r\n      what he had seen. He was good company, I won\u2019t deny it, and he\r\n      had wonderful polite ways with him for a sailor man, so that I\r\n      think there must have been a time when he knew more of the poop\r\n      than the forecastle. For a month he was in and out of my house,\r\n      and never once did it cross my mind that harm might come of his\r\n      soft, tricky ways. And then at last something made me suspect,\r\n      and from that day my peace was gone forever.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was only a little thing, too. I had come into the parlour\r\n      unexpected, and as I walked in at the door I saw a light of\r\n      welcome on my wife\u2019s face. But as she saw who it was it faded\r\n      again, and she turned away with a look of disappointment. That\r\n      was enough for me. There was no one but Alec Fairbairn whose step\r\n      she could have mistaken for mine. If I could have seen him then I\r\n      should have killed him, for I have always been like a madman when\r\n      my temper gets loose. Mary saw the devil\u2019s light in my eyes, and\r\n      she ran forward with her hands on my sleeve. \u2018Don\u2019t, Jim, don\u2019t!\u2019\r\n      says she. \u2018Where\u2019s Sarah?\u2019 I asked. \u2018In the kitchen,\u2019 says she.\r\n      \u2018Sarah,\u2019 says I as I went in, \u2018this man Fairbairn is never to\r\n      darken my door again.\u2019 \u2018Why not?\u2019 says she. \u2018Because I order it.\u2019\r\n      \u2018Oh!\u2019 says she, \u2018if my friends are not good enough for this\r\n      house, then I am not good enough for it either.\u2019 \u2018You can do what\r\n      you like,\u2019 says I, \u2018but if Fairbairn shows his face here again\r\n      I\u2019ll send you one of his ears for a keepsake.\u2019 She was frightened\r\n      by my face, I think, for she never answered a word, and the same\r\n      evening she left my house.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know now whether it was pure devilry on the part\r\n      of this woman, or whether she thought that she could turn me\r\n      against my wife by encouraging her to misbehave. Anyway, she took\r\n      a house just two streets off and let lodgings to sailors.\r\n      Fairbairn used to stay there, and Mary would go round to have tea\r\n      with her sister and him. How often she went I don\u2019t know, but I\r\n      followed her one day, and as I broke in at the door Fairbairn got\r\n      away over the back garden wall, like the cowardly skunk that he\r\n      was. I swore to my wife that I would kill her if I found her in\r\n      his company again, and I led her back with me, sobbing and\r\n      trembling, and as white as a piece of paper. There was no trace\r\n      of love between us any longer. I could see that she hated me and\r\n      feared me, and when the thought of it drove me to drink, then she\r\n      despised me as well.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, Sarah found that she could not make a living in Liverpool,\r\n      so she went back, as I understand, to live with her sister in\r\n      Croydon, and things jogged on much the same as ever at home. And\r\n      then came this last week and all the misery and ruin.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was in this way. We had gone on the _May Day_ for a round\r\n      voyage of seven days, but a hogshead got loose and started one of\r\n      our plates, so that we had to put back into port for twelve\r\n      hours. I left the ship and came home, thinking what a surprise it\r\n      would be for my wife, and hoping that maybe she would be glad to\r\n      see me so soon. The thought was in my head as I turned into my\r\n      own street, and at that moment a cab passed me, and there she\r\n      was, sitting by the side of Fairbairn, the two chatting and\r\n      laughing, with never a thought for me as I stood watching them\r\n      from the footpath.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI tell you, and I give you my word for it, that from that moment\r\n      I was not my own master, and it is all like a dim dream when I\r\n      look back on it. I had been drinking hard of late, and the two\r\n      things together fairly turned my brain. There\u2019s something\r\n      throbbing in my head now, like a docker\u2019s hammer, but that\r\n      morning I seemed to have all Niagara whizzing and buzzing in my\r\n      ears.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, I took to my heels, and I ran after the cab. I had a heavy\r\n      oak stick in my hand, and I tell you I saw red from the first;\r\n      but as I ran I got cunning, too, and hung back a little to see\r\n      them without being seen. They pulled up soon at the railway\r\n      station. There was a good crowd round the booking-office, so I\r\n      got quite close to them without being seen. They took tickets for\r\n      New Brighton. So did I, but I got in three carriages behind them.\r\n      When we reached it they walked along the Parade, and I was never\r\n      more than a hundred yards from them. At last I saw them hire a\r\n      boat and start for a row, for it was a very hot day, and they\r\n      thought, no doubt, that it would be cooler on the water.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was just as if they had been given into my hands. There was a\r\n      bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred\r\n      yards. I hired a boat for myself, and I pulled after them. I\r\n      could see the blur of their craft, but they were going nearly as\r\n      fast as I, and they must have been a long mile from the shore\r\n      before I caught them up. The haze was like a curtain all round\r\n      us, and there were we three in the middle of it. My God, shall I\r\n      ever forget their faces when they saw who was in the boat that\r\n      was closing in upon them? She screamed out. He swore like a\r\n      madman and jabbed at me with an oar, for he must have seen death\r\n      in my eyes. I got past it and got one in with my stick that\r\n      crushed his head like an egg. I would have spared her, perhaps,\r\n      for all my madness, but she threw her arms round him, crying out\r\n      to him, and calling him \u2018Alec.\u2019 I struck again, and she lay\r\n      stretched beside him. I was like a wild beast then that had\r\n      tasted blood. If Sarah had been there, by the Lord, she should\r\n      have joined them. I pulled out my knife, and\u2014well, there! I\u2019ve\r\n      said enough. It gave me a kind of savage joy when I thought how\r\n      Sarah would feel when she had such signs as these of what her\r\n      meddling had brought about. Then I tied the bodies into the boat,\r\n      stove a plank, and stood by until they had sunk. I knew very well\r\n      that the owner would think that they had lost their bearings in\r\n      the haze, and had drifted off out to sea. I cleaned myself up,\r\n      got back to land, and joined my ship without a soul having a\r\n      suspicion of what had passed. That night I made up the packet for\r\n      Sarah Cushing, and next day I sent it from Belfast.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere you have the whole truth of it. You can hang me, or do\r\n      what you like with me, but you cannot punish me as I have been\r\n      punished already. I cannot shut my eyes but I see those two faces\r\n      staring at me\u2014staring at me as they stared when my boat broke\r\n      through the haze. I killed them quick, but they are killing me\r\n      slow; and if I have another night of it I shall be either mad or\r\n      dead before morning. You won\u2019t put me alone into a cell, sir? For\r\n      pity\u2019s sake don\u2019t, and may you be treated in your day of agony as\r\n      you treat me now.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat is the meaning of it, Watson?\u201d said Holmes solemnly as he\r\n      laid down the paper. \u201cWhat object is served by this circle of\r\n      misery and violence and fear? It must tend to some end, or else\r\n      our universe is ruled by chance, which is unthinkable. But what\r\n      end? There is the great standing perennial problem to which human\r\n      reason is as far from an answer as ever.\u201d\r\n", "The Musgave Ritual": "      An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend\r\n      Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he\r\n      was the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also\r\n      he affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the\r\n      less in his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever\r\n      drove a fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least\r\n      conventional in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in\r\n      Afghanistan, coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of\r\n      disposition, has made me rather more lax than befits a medical\r\n      man. But with me there is a limit, and when I find a man who\r\n      keeps his cigars in the coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end\r\n      of a Persian slipper, and his unanswered correspondence\r\n      transfixed by a jack-knife into the very centre of his wooden\r\n      mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself virtuous airs. I have\r\n      always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an\r\n      open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his queer humours,\r\n      would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred\r\n      Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a\r\n      patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that\r\n      neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was\r\n      improved by it.\r\n\r\n      Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics\r\n      which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of\r\n      turning up in the butter-dish or in even less desirable places.\r\n      But his papers were my great crux. He had a horror of destroying\r\n      documents, especially those which were connected with his past\r\n      cases, and yet it was only once in every year or two that he\r\n      would muster energy to docket and arrange them; for, as I have\r\n      mentioned somewhere in these incoherent memoirs, the outbursts of\r\n      passionate energy when he performed the remarkable feats with\r\n      which his name is associated were followed by reactions of\r\n      lethargy during which he would lie about with his violin and his\r\n      books, hardly moving save from the sofa to the table. Thus month\r\n      after month his papers accumulated, until every corner of the\r\n      room was stacked with bundles of manuscript which were on no\r\n      account to be burned, and which could not be put away save by\r\n      their owner. One winter\u2019s night, as we sat together by the fire,\r\n      I ventured to suggest to him that, as he had finished pasting\r\n      extracts into his common-place book, he might employ the next two\r\n      hours in making our room a little more habitable. He could not\r\n      deny the justice of my request, so with a rather rueful face he\r\n      went off to his bedroom, from which he returned presently pulling\r\n      a large tin box behind him. This he placed in the middle of the\r\n      floor and, squatting down upon a stool in front of it, he threw\r\n      back the lid. I could see that it was already a third full of\r\n      bundles of paper tied up with red tape into separate packages.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are cases enough here, Watson,\u201d said he, looking at me\r\n      with mischievous eyes. \u201cI think that if you knew all that I had\r\n      in this box you would ask me to pull some out instead of putting\r\n      others in.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese are the records of your early work, then?\u201d I asked. \u201cI\r\n      have often wished that I had notes of those cases.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, my boy, these were all done prematurely before my\r\n      biographer had come to glorify me.\u201d He lifted bundle after bundle\r\n      in a tender, caressing sort of way. \u201cThey are not all successes,\r\n      Watson,\u201d said he. \u201cBut there are some pretty little problems\r\n      among them. Here\u2019s the record of the Tarleton murders, and the\r\n      case of Vamberry, the wine merchant, and the adventure of the old\r\n      Russian woman, and the singular affair of the aluminium crutch,\r\n      as well as a full account of Ricoletti of the club-foot, and his\r\n      abominable wife. And here\u2014ah, now, this really is something a\r\n      little _recherch\u00e9_.\u201d\r\n\r\n      He dived his arm down to the bottom of the chest, and brought up\r\n      a small wooden box with a sliding lid, such as children\u2019s toys\r\n      are kept in. From within he produced a crumpled piece of paper,\r\n      an old-fashioned brass key, a peg of wood with a ball of string\r\n      attached to it, and three rusty old disks of metal.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, my boy, what do you make of this lot?\u201d he asked, smiling\r\n      at my expression.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is a curious collection.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cVery curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you\r\n      as being more curious still.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese relics have a history then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSo much so that they _are_ history.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one, and laid them along\r\n      the edge of the table. Then he reseated himself in his chair and\r\n      looked them over with a gleam of satisfaction in his eyes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThese,\u201d said he, \u201care all that I have left to remind me of the\r\n      adventure of the Musgrave Ritual.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I had heard him mention the case more than once, though I had\r\n      never been able to gather the details.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI should be so glad,\u201d said I, \u201cif you would give me an account\r\n      of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd leave the litter as it is?\u201d he cried, mischievously. \u201cYour\r\n      tidiness won\u2019t bear much strain after all, Watson. But I should\r\n      be glad that you should add this case to your annals, for there\r\n      are points in it which make it quite unique in the criminal\r\n      records of this or, I believe, of any other country. A collection\r\n      of my trifling achievements would certainly be incomplete which\r\n      contained no account of this very singular business.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou may remember how the affair of the _Gloria Scott_, and my\r\n      conversation with the unhappy man whose fate I told you of, first\r\n      turned my attention in the direction of the profession which has\r\n      become my life\u2019s work. You see me now when my name has become\r\n      known far and wide, and when I am generally recognised both by\r\n      the public and by the official force as being a final court of\r\n      appeal in doubtful cases. Even when you knew me first, at the\r\n      time of the affair which you have commemorated in \u2018A Study in\r\n      Scarlet,\u2019 I had already established a considerable, though not a\r\n      very lucrative, connection. You can hardly realize, then, how\r\n      difficult I found it at first, and how long I had to wait before\r\n      I succeeded in making any headway.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen I first came up to London I had rooms in Montague Street,\r\n      just round the corner from the British Museum, and there I\r\n      waited, filling in my too abundant leisure time by studying all\r\n      those branches of science which might make me more efficient. Now\r\n      and again cases came in my way, principally through the\r\n      introduction of old fellow-students, for during my last years at\r\n      the University there was a good deal of talk there about myself\r\n      and my methods. The third of these cases was that of the Musgrave\r\n      Ritual, and it is to the interest which was aroused by that\r\n      singular chain of events, and the large issues which proved to be\r\n      at stake, that I trace my first stride towards the position which\r\n      I now hold.\r\n\r\n      \u201cReginald Musgrave had been in the same college as myself, and I\r\n      had some slight acquaintance with him. He was not generally\r\n      popular among the undergraduates, though it always seemed to me\r\n      that what was set down as pride was really an attempt to cover\r\n      extreme natural diffidence. In appearance he was a man of\r\n      exceedingly aristocratic type, thin, high-nosed, and large-eyed,\r\n      with languid and yet courtly manners. He was indeed a scion of\r\n      one of the very oldest families in the kingdom, though his branch\r\n      was a cadet one which had separated from the northern Musgraves\r\n      some time in the sixteenth century, and had established itself in\r\n      western Sussex, where the Manor House of Hurlstone is perhaps the\r\n      oldest inhabited building in the county. Something of his\r\n      birthplace seemed to cling to the man, and I never looked at his\r\n      pale, keen face or the poise of his head without associating him\r\n      with grey archways and mullioned windows and all the venerable\r\n      wreckage of a feudal keep. Once or twice we drifted into talk,\r\n      and I can remember that more than once he expressed a keen\r\n      interest in my methods of observation and inference.\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor four years I had seen nothing of him until one morning he\r\n      walked into my room in Montague Street. He had changed little,\r\n      was dressed like a young man of fashion\u2014he was always a bit of a\r\n      dandy\u2014and preserved the same quiet, suave manner which had\r\n      formerly distinguished him.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018How has all gone with you Musgrave?\u2019 I asked, after we had\r\n      cordially shaken hands.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You probably heard of my poor father\u2019s death,\u2019 said he; \u2018he was\r\n      carried off about two years ago. Since then I have of course had\r\n      the Hurlstone estates to manage, and as I am member for my\r\n      district as well, my life has been a busy one. But I understand,\r\n      Holmes, that you are turning to practical ends those powers with\r\n      which you used to amaze us?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yes,\u2019 said I, \u2018I have taken to living by my wits.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I am delighted to hear it, for your advice at present would be\r\n      exceedingly valuable to me. We have had some very strange doings\r\n      at Hurlstone, and the police have been able to throw no light\r\n      upon the matter. It is really the most extraordinary and\r\n      inexplicable business.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can imagine with what eagerness I listened to him, Watson,\r\n      for the very chance for which I had been panting during all those\r\n      months of inaction seemed to have come within my reach. In my\r\n      inmost heart I believed that I could succeed where others failed,\r\n      and now I had the opportunity to test myself.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Pray, let me have the details,\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n      \u201cReginald Musgrave sat down opposite to me, and lit the cigarette\r\n      which I had pushed towards him.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You must know,\u2019 said he, \u2018that though I am a bachelor, I have\r\n      to keep up a considerable staff of servants at Hurlstone, for it\r\n      is a rambling old place, and takes a good deal of looking after.\r\n      I preserve, too, and in the pheasant months I usually have a\r\n      house-party, so that it would not do to be short-handed.\r\n      Altogether there are eight maids, the cook, the butler, two\r\n      footmen, and a boy. The garden and the stables of course have a\r\n      separate staff.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Of these servants the one who had been longest in our service\r\n      was Brunton the butler. He was a young schoolmaster out of place\r\n      when he was first taken up by my father, but he was a man of\r\n      great energy and character, and he soon became quite invaluable\r\n      in the household. He was a well-grown, handsome man, with a\r\n      splendid forehead, and though he has been with us for twenty\r\n      years he cannot be more than forty now. With his personal\r\n      advantages and his extraordinary gifts\u2014for he can speak several\r\n      languages and play nearly every musical instrument\u2014it is\r\n      wonderful that he should have been satisfied so long in such a\r\n      position, but I suppose that he was comfortable, and lacked\r\n      energy to make any change. The butler of Hurlstone is always a\r\n      thing that is remembered by all who visit us.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But this paragon has one fault. He is a bit of a Don Juan, and\r\n      you can imagine that for a man like him it is not a very\r\n      difficult part to play in a quiet country district. When he was\r\n      married it was all right, but since he has been a widower we have\r\n      had no end of trouble with him. A few months ago we were in hopes\r\n      that he was about to settle down again for he became engaged to\r\n      Rachel Howells, our second housemaid; but he has thrown her over\r\n      since then and taken up with Janet Tregellis, the daughter of the\r\n      head gamekeeper. Rachel\u2014who is a very good girl, but of an\r\n      excitable Welsh temperament\u2014had a sharp touch of brain-fever, and\r\n      goes about the house now\u2014or did until yesterday\u2014like a black-eyed\r\n      shadow of her former self. That was our first drama at Hurlstone;\r\n      but a second one came to drive it from our minds, and it was\r\n      prefaced by the disgrace and dismissal of butler Brunton.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018This was how it came about. I have said that the man was\r\n      intelligent, and this very intelligence has caused his ruin, for\r\n      it seems to have led to an insatiable curiosity about things\r\n      which did not in the least concern him. I had no idea of the\r\n      lengths to which this would carry him, until the merest accident\r\n      opened my eyes to it.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I have said that the house is a rambling one. One day last\r\n      week\u2014on Thursday night, to be more exact\u2014I found that I could not\r\n      sleep, having foolishly taken a cup of strong _caf\u00e9 noir_ after\r\n      my dinner. After struggling against it until two in the morning,\r\n      I felt that it was quite hopeless, so I rose and lit the candle\r\n      with the intention of continuing a novel which I was reading. The\r\n      book, however, had been left in the billiard-room, so I pulled on\r\n      my dressing-gown and started off to get it.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018In order to reach the billiard-room I had to descend a flight\r\n      of stairs and then to cross the head of a passage which led to\r\n      the library and the gun-room. You can imagine my surprise when,\r\n      as I looked down this corridor, I saw a glimmer of light coming\r\n      from the open door of the library. I had myself extinguished the\r\n      lamp and closed the door before coming to bed. Naturally my first\r\n      thought was of burglars. The corridors at Hurlstone have their\r\n      walls largely decorated with trophies of old weapons. From one of\r\n      these I picked a battle-axe, and then, leaving my candle behind\r\n      me, I crept on tiptoe down the passage and peeped in at the open\r\n      door.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Brunton, the butler, was in the library. He was sitting, fully\r\n      dressed, in an easy-chair, with a slip of paper which looked like\r\n      a map upon his knee, and his forehead sunk forward upon his hand\r\n      in deep thought. I stood dumb with astonishment, watching him\r\n      from the darkness. A small taper on the edge of the table shed a\r\n      feeble light which sufficed to show me that he was fully dressed.\r\n      Suddenly, as I looked, he rose from his chair, and walking over\r\n      to a bureau at the side, he unlocked it and drew out one of the\r\n      drawers. From this he took a paper, and returning to his seat he\r\n      flattened it out beside the taper on the edge of the table, and\r\n      began to study it with minute attention. My indignation at this\r\n      calm examination of our family documents overcame me so far that\r\n      I took a step forward, and Brunton, looking up, saw me standing\r\n      in the doorway. He sprang to his feet, his face turned livid with\r\n      fear, and he thrust into his breast the chart-like paper which he\r\n      had been originally studying.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cSo!\u201d said I. \u201cThis is how you repay the trust which we have\r\n      reposed in you. You will leave my service to-morrow.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He bowed with the look of a man who is utterly crushed, and\r\n      slunk past me without a word. The taper was still on the table,\r\n      and by its light I glanced to see what the paper was which\r\n      Brunton had taken from the bureau. To my surprise it was nothing\r\n      of any importance at all, but simply a copy of the questions and\r\n      answers in the singular old observance called the Musgrave\r\n      Ritual. It is a sort of ceremony peculiar to our family, which\r\n      each Musgrave for centuries past has gone through on his coming\r\n      of age\u2014a thing of private interest, and perhaps of some little\r\n      importance to the archaeologist, like our own blazonings and\r\n      charges, but of no practical use whatever.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018We had better come back to the paper afterwards,\u2019 said I.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018If you think it really necessary,\u2019 he answered, with some\r\n      hesitation. \u2018To continue my statement, however: I relocked the\r\n      bureau, using the key which Brunton had left, and I had turned to\r\n      go when I was surprised to find that the butler had returned, and\r\n      was standing before me.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cMr. Musgrave, sir,\u201d he cried, in a voice which was hoarse with\r\n      emotion, \u201cI can\u2019t bear disgrace, sir. I\u2019ve always been proud\r\n      above my station in life, and disgrace would kill me. My blood\r\n      will be on your head, sir\u2014it will, indeed\u2014if you drive me to\r\n      despair. If you cannot keep me after what has passed, then for\r\n      God\u2019s sake let me give you notice and leave in a month, as if of\r\n      my own free will. I could stand that, Mr. Musgrave, but not to be\r\n      cast out before all the folk that I know so well.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cYou don\u2019t deserve much consideration, Brunton,\u201d I answered.\r\n      \u201cYour conduct has been most infamous. However, as you have been a\r\n      long time in the family, I have no wish to bring public disgrace\r\n      upon you. A month, however is too long. Take yourself away in a\r\n      week, and give what reason you like for going.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cOnly a week, sir?\u201d he cried, in a despairing voice. \u201cA\r\n      fortnight\u2014say at least a fortnight!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cA week,\u201d I repeated, \u201cand you may consider yourself to have\r\n      been very leniently dealt with.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He crept away, his face sunk upon his breast, like a broken\r\n      man, while I put out the light and returned to my room.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018For two days after this Brunton was most assiduous in his\r\n      attention to his duties. I made no allusion to what had passed,\r\n      and waited with some curiosity to see how he would cover his\r\n      disgrace. On the third morning, however he did not appear, as was\r\n      his custom, after breakfast to receive my instructions for the\r\n      day. As I left the dining-room I happened to meet Rachel Howells,\r\n      the maid. I have told you that she had only recently recovered\r\n      from an illness, and was looking so wretchedly pale and wan that\r\n      I remonstrated with her for being at work.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cYou should be in bed,\u201d I said. \u201cCome back to your duties when\r\n      you are stronger.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018She looked at me with so strange an expression that I began to\r\n      suspect that her brain was affected.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cI am strong enough, Mr. Musgrave,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cWe will see what the doctor says,\u201d I answered. \u201cYou must stop\r\n      work now, and when you go downstairs just say that I wish to see\r\n      Brunton.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cThe butler is gone,\u201d said she.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cGone! Gone where?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018\u201cHe is gone. No one has seen him. He is not in his room. Oh,\r\n      yes, he is gone, he is gone!\u201d She fell back against the wall with\r\n      shriek after shriek of laughter, while I, horrified at this\r\n      sudden hysterical attack, rushed to the bell to summon help. The\r\n      girl was taken to her room, still screaming and sobbing, while I\r\n      made inquiries about Brunton. There was no doubt about it that he\r\n      had disappeared. His bed had not been slept in, he had been seen\r\n      by no one since he had retired to his room the night before, and\r\n      yet it was difficult to see how he could have left the house, as\r\n      both windows and doors were found to be fastened in the morning.\r\n      His clothes, his watch, and even his money were in his room, but\r\n      the black suit which he usually wore was missing. His slippers,\r\n      too, were gone, but his boots were left behind. Where then could\r\n      butler Brunton have gone in the night, and what could have become\r\n      of him now?\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Of course we searched the house from cellar to garret, but\r\n      there was no trace of him. It is, as I have said, a labyrinth of\r\n      an old house, especially the original wing, which is now\r\n      practically uninhabited; but we ransacked every room and cellar\r\n      without discovering the least sign of the missing man. It was\r\n      incredible to me that he could have gone away leaving all his\r\n      property behind him, and yet where could he be? I called in the\r\n      local police, but without success. Rain had fallen on the night\r\n      before and we examined the lawn and the paths all round the\r\n      house, but in vain. Matters were in this state, when a new\r\n      development quite drew our attention away from the original\r\n      mystery.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018For two days Rachel Howells had been so ill, sometimes\r\n      delirious, sometimes hysterical, that a nurse had been employed\r\n      to sit up with her at night. On the third night after Brunton\u2019s\r\n      disappearance, the nurse, finding her patient sleeping nicely,\r\n      had dropped into a nap in the armchair, when she woke in the\r\n      early morning to find the bed empty, the window open, and no\r\n      signs of the invalid. I was instantly aroused, and, with the two\r\n      footmen, started off at once in search of the missing girl. It\r\n      was not difficult to tell the direction which she had taken, for,\r\n      starting from under her window, we could follow her footmarks\r\n      easily across the lawn to the edge of the mere, where they\r\n      vanished close to the gravel path which leads out of the grounds.\r\n      The lake there is eight feet deep, and you can imagine our\r\n      feelings when we saw that the trail of the poor demented girl\r\n      came to an end at the edge of it.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Of course, we had the drags at once, and set to work to recover\r\n      the remains, but no trace of the body could we find. On the other\r\n      hand, we brought to the surface an object of a most unexpected\r\n      kind. It was a linen bag which contained within it a mass of old\r\n      rusted and discoloured metal and several dull-coloured pieces of\r\n      pebble or glass. This strange find was all that we could get from\r\n      the mere, and, although we made every possible search and inquiry\r\n      yesterday, we know nothing of the fate either of Rachel Howells\r\n      or of Richard Brunton. The county police are at their wits\u2019 end,\r\n      and I have come up to you as a last resource.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou can imagine, Watson, with what eagerness I listened to this\r\n      extraordinary sequence of events, and endeavoured to piece them\r\n      together, and to devise some common thread upon which they might\r\n      all hang. The butler was gone. The maid was gone. The maid had\r\n      loved the butler, but had afterwards had cause to hate him. She\r\n      was of Welsh blood, fiery and passionate. She had been terribly\r\n      excited immediately after his disappearance. She had flung into\r\n      the lake a bag containing some curious contents. These were all\r\n      factors which had to be taken into consideration, and yet none of\r\n      them got quite to the heart of the matter. What was the\r\n      starting-point of this chain of events? There lay the end of this\r\n      tangled line.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I must see that paper, Musgrave,\u2019 said I, \u2018which this butler of\r\n      yours thought it worth his while to consult, even at the risk of\r\n      the loss of his place.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is rather an absurd business, this ritual of ours,\u2019 he\r\n      answered. \u2018But it has at least the saving grace of antiquity to\r\n      excuse it. I have a copy of the questions and answers here if you\r\n      care to run your eye over them.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe handed me the very paper which I have here, Watson, and this\r\n      is the strange catechism to which each Musgrave had to submit\r\n      when he came to man\u2019s estate. I will read you the questions and\r\n      answers as they stand.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Whose was it?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018His who is gone.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Who shall have it?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He who will come.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where was the sun?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Over the oak.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Where was the shadow?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Under the elm.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow was it stepped?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018North by ten and by ten, east by five and by five, south by two\r\n      and by two, west by one and by one, and so under.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What shall we give for it?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018All that is ours.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Why should we give it?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018For the sake of the trust.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The original has no date, but is in the spelling of the middle\r\n      of the seventeenth century,\u2019 remarked Musgrave. \u2018I am afraid,\r\n      however, that it can be of little help to you in solving this\r\n      mystery.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018At least,\u2019 said I, \u2018it gives us another mystery, and one which\r\n      is even more interesting than the first. It may be that the\r\n      solution of the one may prove to be the solution of the other.\r\n      You will excuse me, Musgrave, if I say that your butler appears\r\n      to me to have been a very clever man, and to have had a clearer\r\n      insight than ten generations of his masters.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I hardly follow you,\u2019 said Musgrave. \u2018The paper seems to me to\r\n      be of no practical importance.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018But to me it seems immensely practical, and I fancy that\r\n      Brunton took the same view. He had probably seen it before that\r\n      night on which you caught him.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is very possible. We took no pains to hide it.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018He simply wished, I should imagine, to refresh his memory upon\r\n      that last occasion. He had, as I understand, some sort of map or\r\n      chart which he was comparing with the manuscript, and which he\r\n      thrust into his pocket when you appeared.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That is true. But what could he have to do with this old family\r\n      custom of ours, and what does this rigmarole mean?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t think that we should have much difficulty in\r\n      determining that,\u2019 said I; \u2018with your permission we will take the\r\n      first train down to Sussex, and go a little more deeply into the\r\n      matter upon the spot.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe same afternoon saw us both at Hurlstone. Possibly you have\r\n      seen pictures and read descriptions of the famous old building,\r\n      so I will confine my account of it to saying that it is built in\r\n      the shape of an L, the long arm being the more modern portion,\r\n      and the shorter the ancient nucleus, from which the other had\r\n      developed. Over the low, heavily-lintelled door, in the centre of\r\n      this old part, is chiseled the date, 1607, but experts are agreed\r\n      that the beams and stonework are really much older than this. The\r\n      enormously thick walls and tiny windows of this part had in the\r\n      last century driven the family into building the new wing, and\r\n      the old one was used now as a storehouse and a cellar, when it\r\n      was used at all. A splendid park with fine old timber surrounds\r\n      the house, and the lake, to which my client had referred, lay\r\n      close to the avenue, about two hundred yards from the building.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was already firmly convinced, Watson, that there were not\r\n      three separate mysteries here, but one only, and that if I could\r\n      read the Musgrave Ritual aright I should hold in my hand the clue\r\n      which would lead me to the truth concerning both the butler\r\n      Brunton and the maid Howells. To that then I turned all my\r\n      energies. Why should this servant be so anxious to master this\r\n      old formula? Evidently because he saw something in it which had\r\n      escaped all those generations of country squires, and from which\r\n      he expected some personal advantage. What was it then, and how\r\n      had it affected his fate?\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was perfectly obvious to me, on reading the Ritual, that the\r\n      measurements must refer to some spot to which the rest of the\r\n      document alluded, and that if we could find that spot, we should\r\n      be in a fair way towards finding what the secret was which the\r\n      old Musgraves had thought it necessary to embalm in so curious a\r\n      fashion. There were two guides given us to start with, an oak and\r\n      an elm. As to the oak there could be no question at all. Right in\r\n      front of the house, upon the left-hand side of the drive, there\r\n      stood a patriarch among oaks, one of the most magnificent trees\r\n      that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018That was there when your Ritual was drawn up,\u2019 said I, as we\r\n      drove past it.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It was there at the Norman Conquest in all probability,\u2019 he\r\n      answered. \u2018It has a girth of twenty-three feet.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Have you any old elms?\u2019 I asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018There used to be a very old one over yonder but it was struck\r\n      by lightning ten years ago, and we cut down the stump.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You can see where it used to be?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Oh, yes.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018There are no other elms?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018No old ones, but plenty of beeches.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I should like to see where it grew.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe had driven up in a dog-cart, and my client led me away at\r\n      once, without our entering the house, to the scar on the lawn\r\n      where the elm had stood. It was nearly midway between the oak and\r\n      the house. My investigation seemed to be progressing.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I suppose it is impossible to find out how high the elm was?\u2019 I\r\n      asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018I can give you it at once. It was sixty-four feet.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018How do you come to know it?\u2019 I asked, in surprise.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018When my old tutor used to give me an exercise in trigonometry,\r\n      it always took the shape of measuring heights. When I was a lad I\r\n      worked out every tree and building in the estate.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis was an unexpected piece of luck. My data were coming more\r\n      quickly than I could have reasonably hoped.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Tell me,\u2019 I asked, \u2018did your butler ever ask you such a\r\n      question?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cReginald Musgrave looked at me in astonishment. \u2018Now that you\r\n      call it to my mind,\u2019 he answered, \u2018Brunton _did_ ask me about the\r\n      height of the tree some months ago, in connection with some\r\n      little argument with the groom.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis was excellent news, Watson, for it showed me that I was on\r\n      the right road. I looked up at the sun. It was low in the\r\n      heavens, and I calculated that in less than an hour it would lie\r\n      just above the topmost branches of the old oak. One condition\r\n      mentioned in the Ritual would then be fulfilled. And the shadow\r\n      of the elm must mean the farther end of the shadow, otherwise the\r\n      trunk would have been chosen as the guide. I had, then, to find\r\n      where the far end of the shadow would fall when the sun was just\r\n      clear of the oak.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat must have been difficult, Holmes, when the elm was no\r\n      longer there.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, at least I knew that if Brunton could do it, I could also.\r\n      Besides, there was no real difficulty. I went with Musgrave to\r\n      his study and whittled myself this peg, to which I tied this long\r\n      string with a knot at each yard. Then I took two lengths of a\r\n      fishing-rod, which came to just six feet, and I went back with my\r\n      client to where the elm had been. The sun was just grazing the\r\n      top of the oak. I fastened the rod on end, marked out the\r\n      direction of the shadow, and measured it. It was nine feet in\r\n      length.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOf course the calculation now was a simple one. If a rod of six\r\n      feet threw a shadow of nine, a tree of sixty-four feet would\r\n      throw one of ninety-six, and the line of the one would of course\r\n      be the line of the other. I measured out the distance, which\r\n      brought me almost to the wall of the house, and I thrust a peg\r\n      into the spot. You can imagine my exultation, Watson, when within\r\n      two inches of my peg I saw a conical depression in the ground. I\r\n      knew that it was the mark made by Brunton in his measurements,\r\n      and that I was still upon his trail.\r\n\r\n      \u201cFrom this starting-point I proceeded to step, having first taken\r\n      the cardinal points by my pocket-compass. Ten steps with each\r\n      foot took me along parallel with the wall of the house, and again\r\n      I marked my spot with a peg. Then I carefully paced off five to\r\n      the east and two to the south. It brought me to the very\r\n      threshold of the old door. Two steps to the west meant now that I\r\n      was to go two paces down the stone-flagged passage, and this was\r\n      the place indicated by the Ritual.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNever have I felt such a cold chill of disappointment, Watson.\r\n      For a moment it seemed to me that there must be some radical\r\n      mistake in my calculations. The setting sun shone full upon the\r\n      passage floor, and I could see that the old, foot-worn grey\r\n      stones with which it was paved were firmly cemented together, and\r\n      had certainly not been moved for many a long year. Brunton had\r\n      not been at work here. I tapped upon the floor, but it sounded\r\n      the same all over, and there was no sign of any crack or crevice.\r\n      But, fortunately, Musgrave, who had begun to appreciate the\r\n      meaning of my proceedings, and who was now as excited as myself,\r\n      took out his manuscript to check my calculation.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And under,\u2019 he cried. \u2018You have omitted the \u201cand under.\u201d\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had thought that it meant that we were to dig, but now, of\r\n      course, I saw at once that I was wrong. \u2018There is a cellar under\r\n      this then?\u2019 I cried.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Yes, and as old as the house. Down here, through this door.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe went down a winding stone stair, and my companion, striking a\r\n      match, lit a large lantern which stood on a barrel in the corner.\r\n      In an instant it was obvious that we had at last come upon the\r\n      true place, and that we had not been the only people to visit the\r\n      spot recently.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt had been used for the storage of wood, but the billets, which\r\n      had evidently been littered over the floor, were now piled at the\r\n      sides, so as to leave a clear space in the middle. In this space\r\n      lay a large and heavy flagstone with a rusted iron ring in the\r\n      centre to which a thick shepherd\u2019s-check muffler was attached.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018By Jove!\u2019 cried my client. \u2018That\u2019s Brunton\u2019s muffler. I have\r\n      seen it on him, and could swear to it. What has the villain been\r\n      doing here?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt my suggestion a couple of the county police were summoned to\r\n      be present, and I then endeavoured to raise the stone by pulling\r\n      on the cravat. I could only move it slightly, and it was with the\r\n      aid of one of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying\r\n      it to one side. A black hole yawned beneath into which we all\r\n      peered, while Musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down the\r\n      lantern.\r\n\r\n      \u201cA small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay\r\n      open to us. At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden\r\n      box, the lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious\r\n      old-fashioned key projecting from the lock. It was furred outside\r\n      by a thick layer of dust, and damp and worms had eaten through\r\n      the wood, so that a crop of livid fungi was growing on the inside\r\n      of it. Several discs of metal, old coins apparently, such as I\r\n      hold here, were scattered over the bottom of the box, but it\r\n      contained nothing else.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAt the moment, however, we had no thought for the old chest, for\r\n      our eyes were riveted upon that which crouched beside it. It was\r\n      the figure of a man, clad in a suit of black, who squatted down\r\n      upon his hams with his forehead sunk upon the edge of the box and\r\n      his two arms thrown out on each side of it. The attitude had\r\n      drawn all the stagnant blood to the face, and no man could have\r\n      recognised that distorted liver-coloured countenance; but his\r\n      height, his dress, and his hair were all sufficient to show my\r\n      client, when we had drawn the body up, that it was indeed his\r\n      missing butler. He had been dead some days, but there was no\r\n      wound or bruise upon his person to show how he had met his\r\n      dreadful end. When his body had been carried from the cellar we\r\n      found ourselves still confronted with a problem which was almost\r\n      as formidable as that with which we had started.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI confess that so far, Watson, I had been disappointed in my\r\n      investigation. I had reckoned upon solving the matter when once I\r\n      had found the place referred to in the Ritual; but now I was\r\n      there, and was apparently as far as ever from knowing what it was\r\n      which the family had concealed with such elaborate precautions.\r\n      It is true that I had thrown a light upon the fate of Brunton,\r\n      but now I had to ascertain how that fate had come upon him, and\r\n      what part had been played in the matter by the woman who had\r\n      disappeared. I sat down upon a keg in the corner and thought the\r\n      whole matter carefully over.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou know my methods in such cases, Watson. I put myself in the\r\n      man\u2019s place and, having first gauged his intelligence, I try to\r\n      imagine how I should myself have proceeded under the same\r\n      circumstances. In this case the matter was simplified by\r\n      Brunton\u2019s intelligence being quite first-rate, so that it was\r\n      unnecessary to make any allowance for the personal equation, as\r\n      the astronomers have dubbed it. He knew that something valuable\r\n      was concealed. He had spotted the place. He found that the stone\r\n      which covered it was just too heavy for a man to move unaided.\r\n      What would he do next? He could not get help from outside, even\r\n      if he had some one whom he could trust, without the unbarring of\r\n      doors and considerable risk of detection. It was better, if he\r\n      could, to have his helpmate inside the house. But whom could he\r\n      ask? This girl had been devoted to him. A man always finds it\r\n      hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman\u2019s love,\r\n      however badly he may have treated her. He would try by a few\r\n      attentions to make his peace with the girl Howells, and then\r\n      would engage her as his accomplice. Together they would come at\r\n      night to the cellar, and their united force would suffice to\r\n      raise the stone. So far I could follow their actions as if I had\r\n      actually seen them.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut for two of them, and one a woman, it must have been heavy\r\n      work the raising of that stone. A burly Sussex policeman and I\r\n      had found it no light job. What would they do to assist them?\r\n      Probably what I should have done myself. I rose and examined\r\n      carefully the different billets of wood which were scattered\r\n      round the floor. Almost at once I came upon what I expected. One\r\n      piece, about three feet in length, had a very marked indentation\r\n      at one end, while several were flattened at the sides as if they\r\n      had been compressed by some considerable weight. Evidently, as\r\n      they had dragged the stone up they had thrust the chunks of wood\r\n      into the chink, until at last, when the opening was large enough\r\n      to crawl through, they would hold it open by a billet placed\r\n      lengthwise, which might very well become indented at the lower\r\n      end, since the whole weight of the stone would press it down on\r\n      to the edge of this other slab. So far I was still on safe\r\n      ground.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now how was I to proceed to reconstruct this midnight drama?\r\n      Clearly, only one could fit into the hole, and that one was\r\n      Brunton. The girl must have waited above. Brunton then unlocked\r\n      the box, handed up the contents presumably\u2014since they were not to\r\n      be found\u2014and then\u2014and then what happened?\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat smouldering fire of vengeance had suddenly sprung into\r\n      flame in this passionate Celtic woman\u2019s soul when she saw the man\r\n      who had wronged her\u2014wronged her, perhaps, far more than we\r\n      suspected\u2014in her power? Was it a chance that the wood had\r\n      slipped, and that the stone had shut Brunton into what had become\r\n      his sepulchre? Had she only been guilty of silence as to his\r\n      fate? Or had some sudden blow from her hand dashed the support\r\n      away and sent the slab crashing down into its place? Be that as\r\n      it might, I seemed to see that woman\u2019s figure still clutching at\r\n      her treasure trove and flying wildly up the winding stair, with\r\n      her ears ringing perhaps with the muffled screams from behind her\r\n      and with the drumming of frenzied hands against the slab of stone\r\n      which was choking her faithless lover\u2019s life out.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHere was the secret of her blanched face, her shaken nerves, her\r\n      peals of hysterical laughter on the next morning. But what had\r\n      been in the box? What had she done with that? Of course, it must\r\n      have been the old metal and pebbles which my client had dragged\r\n      from the mere. She had thrown them in there at the first\r\n      opportunity to remove the last trace of her crime.\r\n\r\n      \u201cFor twenty minutes I had sat motionless, thinking the matter\r\n      out. Musgrave still stood with a very pale face, swinging his\r\n      lantern and peering down into the hole.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018These are coins of Charles the First,\u2019 said he, holding out the\r\n      few which had been in the box; \u2018you see we were right in fixing\r\n      our date for the Ritual.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018We may find something else of Charles the First,\u2019 I cried, as\r\n      the probable meaning of the first two questions of the Ritual\r\n      broke suddenly upon me. \u2018Let me see the contents of the bag which\r\n      you fished from the mere.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe ascended to his study, and he laid the _d\u00e9bris_ before me. I\r\n      could understand his regarding it as of small importance when I\r\n      looked at it, for the metal was almost black and the stones\r\n      lustreless and dull. I rubbed one of them on my sleeve, however,\r\n      and it glowed afterwards like a spark in the dark hollow of my\r\n      hand. The metal work was in the form of a double ring, but it had\r\n      been bent and twisted out of its original shape.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018You must bear in mind,\u2019 said I, \u2018that the Royal party made head\r\n      in England even after the death of the King, and that when they\r\n      at last fled they probably left many of their most precious\r\n      possessions buried behind them, with the intention of returning\r\n      for them in more peaceful times.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018My ancestor, Sir Ralph Musgrave, was a prominent Cavalier and\r\n      the right-hand man of Charles the Second in his wanderings,\u2019 said\r\n      my friend.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah, indeed!\u2019 I answered. \u2018Well now, I think that really should\r\n      give us the last link that we wanted. I must congratulate you on\r\n      coming into the possession, though in rather a tragic manner of a\r\n      relic which is of great intrinsic value, but of even greater\r\n      importance as an historical curiosity.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018What is it, then?\u2019 he gasped in astonishment.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018It is nothing less than the ancient crown of the Kings of\r\n      England.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018The crown!\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Precisely. Consider what the Ritual says: How does it run?\r\n      \u201cWhose was it?\u201d \u201cHis who is gone.\u201d That was after the execution\r\n      of Charles. Then, \u201cWho shall have it?\u201d \u201cHe who will come.\u201d That\r\n      was Charles the Second, whose advent was already foreseen. There\r\n      can, I think, be no doubt that this battered and shapeless diadem\r\n      once encircled the brows of the royal Stuarts.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And how came it in the pond?\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah, that is a question that will take some time to answer.\u2019 And\r\n      with that I sketched out to him the whole long chain of surmise\r\n      and of proof which I had constructed. The twilight had closed in\r\n      and the moon was shining brightly in the sky before my narrative\r\n      was finished.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018And how was it then that Charles did not get his crown when he\r\n      returned?\u2019 asked Musgrave, pushing back the relic into its linen\r\n      bag.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2018Ah, there you lay your finger upon the one point which we shall\r\n      probably never be able to clear up. It is likely that the\r\n      Musgrave who held the secret died in the interval, and by some\r\n      oversight left this guide to his descendant without explaining\r\n      the meaning of it. From that day to this it has been handed down\r\n      from father to son, until at last it came within reach of a man\r\n      who tore its secret out of it and lost his life in the venture.\u2019\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd that\u2019s the story of the Musgrave Ritual, Watson. They have\r\n      the crown down at Hurlstone\u2014though they had some legal bother and\r\n      a considerable sum to pay before they were allowed to retain it.\r\n      I am sure that if you mentioned my name they would be happy to\r\n      show it to you. Of the woman nothing was ever heard, and the\r\n      probability is that she got away out of England and carried\r\n      herself and the memory of her crime to some land beyond the\r\n      seas.\u201d\r\n", "The Reigate Squires": "      It was some time before the health of my friend Mr. Sherlock\r\n      Holmes recovered from the strain caused by his immense exertions\r\n      in the spring of \u201987. The whole question of the\r\n      Netherland-Sumatra Company and of the colossal schemes of Baron\r\n      Maupertuis are too recent in the minds of the public, and are too\r\n      intimately concerned with politics and finance to be fitting\r\n      subjects for this series of sketches. They led, however, in an\r\n      indirect fashion to a singular and complex problem which gave my\r\n      friend an opportunity of demonstrating the value of a fresh\r\n      weapon among the many with which he waged his life-long battle\r\n      against crime.\r\n\r\n      On referring to my notes I see that it was upon the 14th of April\r\n      that I received a telegram from Lyons which informed me that\r\n      Holmes was lying ill in the Hotel Dulong. Within twenty-four\r\n      hours I was in his sick-room, and was relieved to find that there\r\n      was nothing formidable in his symptoms. Even his iron\r\n      constitution, however, had broken down under the strain of an\r\n      investigation which had extended over two months, during which\r\n      period he had never worked less than fifteen hours a day, and had\r\n      more than once, as he assured me, kept to his task for five days\r\n      at a stretch. Even the triumphant issue of his labours could not\r\n      save him from reaction after so terrible an exertion, and at a\r\n      time when Europe was ringing with his name and when his room was\r\n      literally ankle-deep with congratulatory telegrams I found him a\r\n      prey to the blackest depression. Even the knowledge that he had\r\n      succeeded where the police of three countries had failed, and\r\n      that he had outman\u0153uvred at every point the most accomplished\r\n      swindler in Europe, was insufficient to rouse him from his\r\n      nervous prostration.\r\n\r\n      Three days later we were back in Baker Street together; but it\r\n      was evident that my friend would be much the better for a change,\r\n      and the thought of a week of spring time in the country was full\r\n      of attractions to me also. My old friend, Colonel Hayter, who had\r\n      come under my professional care in Afghanistan, had now taken a\r\n      house near Reigate in Surrey, and had frequently asked me to come\r\n      down to him upon a visit. On the last occasion he had remarked\r\n      that if my friend would only come with me he would be glad to\r\n      extend his hospitality to him also. A little diplomacy was\r\n      needed, but when Holmes understood that the establishment was a\r\n      bachelor one, and that he would be allowed the fullest freedom,\r\n      he fell in with my plans and a week after our return from Lyons\r\n      we were under the Colonel\u2019s roof. Hayter was a fine old soldier\r\n      who had seen much of the world, and he soon found, as I had\r\n      expected, that Holmes and he had much in common.\r\n\r\n      On the evening of our arrival we were sitting in the Colonel\u2019s\r\n      gun-room after dinner, Holmes stretched upon the sofa, while\r\n      Hayter and I looked over his little armoury of fire-arms.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy the way,\u201d said he suddenly, \u201cI think I\u2019ll take one of these\r\n      pistols upstairs with me in case we have an alarm.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAn alarm!\u201d said I.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, we\u2019ve had a scare in this part lately. Old Acton, who is\r\n      one of our county magnates, had his house broken into last\r\n      Monday. No great damage done, but the fellows are still at\r\n      large.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNo clue?\u201d asked Holmes, cocking his eye at the Colonel.\r\n\r\n      \u201cNone as yet. But the affair is a petty one, one of our little\r\n      country crimes, which must seem too small for your attention, Mr.\r\n      Holmes, after this great international affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes waved away the compliment, though his smile showed that it\r\n      had pleased him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWas there any feature of interest?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI fancy not. The thieves ransacked the library and got very\r\n      little for their pains. The whole place was turned upside down,\r\n      drawers burst open, and presses ransacked, with the result that\r\n      an odd volume of Pope\u2019s \u2018Homer,\u2019 two plated candlesticks, an\r\n      ivory letter-weight, a small oak barometer, and a ball of twine\r\n      are all that have vanished.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat an extraordinary assortment!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, the fellows evidently grabbed hold of everything they could\r\n      get.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes grunted from the sofa.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe county police ought to make something of that,\u201d said he;\r\n      \u201cwhy, it is surely obvious that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      But I held up a warning finger.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou are here for a rest, my dear fellow. For Heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t\r\n      get started on a new problem when your nerves are all in shreds.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes shrugged his shoulders with a glance of comic resignation\r\n      towards the Colonel, and the talk drifted away into less\r\n      dangerous channels.\r\n\r\n      It was destined, however, that all my professional caution should\r\n      be wasted, for next morning the problem obtruded itself upon us\r\n      in such a way that it was impossible to ignore it, and our\r\n      country visit took a turn which neither of us could have\r\n      anticipated. We were at breakfast when the Colonel\u2019s butler\r\n      rushed in with all his propriety shaken out of him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHave you heard the news, sir?\u201d he gasped. \u201cAt the Cunningham\u2019s\r\n      sir!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBurglary!\u201d cried the Colonel, with his coffee-cup in mid-air.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMurder!\u201d\r\n\r\n      The Colonel whistled. \u201cBy Jove!\u201d said he. \u201cWho\u2019s killed, then?\r\n      The J.P. or his son?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNeither, sir. It was William the coachman. Shot through the\r\n      heart, sir, and never spoke again.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWho shot him, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe burglar, sir. He was off like a shot and got clean away.\r\n      He\u2019d just broke in at the pantry window when William came on him\r\n      and met his end in saving his master\u2019s property.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat time?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was last night, sir, somewhere about twelve.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, then, we\u2019ll step over afterwards,\u201d said the Colonel, coolly\r\n      settling down to his breakfast again. \u201cIt\u2019s a baddish business,\u201d\r\n      he added when the butler had gone; \u201che\u2019s our leading man about\r\n      here, is old Cunningham, and a very decent fellow too. He\u2019ll be\r\n      cut up over this, for the man has been in his service for years\r\n      and was a good servant. It\u2019s evidently the same villains who\r\n      broke into Acton\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd stole that very singular collection,\u201d said Holmes,\r\n      thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHum! It may prove the simplest matter in the world, but all the\r\n      same at first glance this is just a little curious, is it not? A\r\n      gang of burglars acting in the country might be expected to vary\r\n      the scene of their operations, and not to crack two cribs in the\r\n      same district within a few days. When you spoke last night of\r\n      taking precautions I remember that it passed through my mind that\r\n      this was probably the last parish in England to which the thief\r\n      or thieves would be likely to turn their attention\u2014which shows\r\n      that I have still much to learn.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI fancy it\u2019s some local practitioner,\u201d said the Colonel. \u201cIn\r\n      that case, of course, Acton\u2019s and Cunningham\u2019s are just the\r\n      places he would go for, since they are far the largest about\r\n      here.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd richest?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, they ought to be, but they\u2019ve had a lawsuit for some years\r\n      which has sucked the blood out of both of them, I fancy. Old\r\n      Acton has some claim on half Cunningham\u2019s estate, and the lawyers\r\n      have been at it with both hands.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf it\u2019s a local villain there should not be much difficulty in\r\n      running him down,\u201d said Holmes with a yawn. \u201cAll right, Watson, I\r\n      don\u2019t intend to meddle.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cInspector Forrester, sir,\u201d said the butler, throwing open the\r\n      door.\r\n\r\n      The official, a smart, keen-faced young fellow, stepped into the\r\n      room. \u201cGood-morning, Colonel,\u201d said he; \u201cI hope I don\u2019t intrude,\r\n      but we hear that Mr. Holmes of Baker Street is here.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The Colonel waved his hand towards my friend, and the Inspector\r\n      bowed.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe thought that perhaps you would care to step across, Mr.\r\n      Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe fates are against you, Watson,\u201d said he, laughing. \u201cWe were\r\n      chatting about the matter when you came in, Inspector. Perhaps\r\n      you can let us have a few details.\u201d As he leaned back in his\r\n      chair in the familiar attitude I knew that the case was hopeless.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe had no clue in the Acton affair. But here we have plenty to\r\n      go on, and there\u2019s no doubt it is the same party in each case.\r\n      The man was seen.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh!\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir. But he was off like a deer after the shot that killed\r\n      poor William Kirwan was fired. Mr. Cunningham saw him from the\r\n      bedroom window, and Mr. Alec Cunningham saw him from the back\r\n      passage. It was quarter to twelve when the alarm broke out. Mr.\r\n      Cunningham had just got into bed, and Mr. Alec was smoking a pipe\r\n      in his dressing-gown. They both heard William the coachman\r\n      calling for help, and Mr. Alec ran down to see what was the\r\n      matter. The back door was open, and as he came to the foot of the\r\n      stairs he saw two men wrestling together outside. One of them\r\n      fired a shot, the other dropped, and the murderer rushed across\r\n      the garden and over the hedge. Mr. Cunningham, looking out of his\r\n      bedroom, saw the fellow as he gained the road, but lost sight of\r\n      him at once. Mr. Alec stopped to see if he could help the dying\r\n      man, and so the villain got clean away. Beyond the fact that he\r\n      was a middle-sized man and dressed in some dark stuff, we have no\r\n      personal clue; but we are making energetic inquiries, and if he\r\n      is a stranger we shall soon find him out.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat was this William doing there? Did he say anything before he\r\n      died?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNot a word. He lives at the lodge with his mother, and as he was\r\n      a very faithful fellow we imagine that he walked up to the house\r\n      with the intention of seeing that all was right there. Of course\r\n      this Acton business has put every one on their guard. The robber\r\n      must have just burst open the door\u2014the lock has been forced\u2014when\r\n      William came upon him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cDid William say anything to his mother before going out?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cShe is very old and deaf, and we can get no information from\r\n      her. The shock has made her half-witted, but I understand that\r\n      she was never very bright. There is one very important\r\n      circumstance, however. Look at this!\u201d\r\n\r\n      He took a small piece of torn paper from a note-book and spread\r\n      it out upon his knee.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis was found between the finger and thumb of the dead man. It\r\n      appears to be a fragment torn from a larger sheet. You will\r\n      observe that the hour mentioned upon it is the very time at which\r\n      the poor fellow met his fate. You see that his murderer might\r\n      have torn the rest of the sheet from him or he might have taken\r\n      this fragment from the murderer. It reads almost as though it\r\n      were an appointment.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes took up the scrap of paper, a facsimile of which is here\r\n      reproduced.\r\nscrap of paper\r\n\r\n      \u201cPresuming that it is an appointment,\u201d continued the Inspector,\r\n      \u201cit is of course a conceivable theory that this William\r\n      Kirwan\u2014though he had the reputation of being an honest man, may\r\n      have been in league with the thief. He may have met him there,\r\n      may even have helped him to break in the door, and then they may\r\n      have fallen out between themselves.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThis writing is of extraordinary interest,\u201d said Holmes, who had\r\n      been examining it with intense concentration. \u201cThese are much\r\n      deeper waters than I had thought.\u201d He sank his head upon his\r\n      hands, while the Inspector smiled at the effect which his case\r\n      had had upon the famous London specialist.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYour last remark,\u201d said Holmes, presently, \u201cas to the\r\n      possibility of there being an understanding between the burglar\r\n      and the servant, and this being a note of appointment from one to\r\n      the other, is an ingenious and not entirely impossible\r\n      supposition. But this writing opens up\u2014\u201d He sank his head into\r\n      his hands again and remained for some minutes in the deepest\r\n      thought. When he raised his face again, I was surprised to see\r\n      that his cheek was tinged with colour, and his eyes as bright as\r\n      before his illness. He sprang to his feet with all his old\r\n      energy.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what,\u201d said he, \u201cI should like to have a quiet\r\n      little glance into the details of this case. There is something\r\n      in it which fascinates me extremely. If you will permit me,\r\n      Colonel, I will leave my friend Watson and you, and I will step\r\n      round with the Inspector to test the truth of one or two little\r\n      fancies of mine. I will be with you again in half an hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n      An hour and half had elapsed before the Inspector returned alone.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMr. Holmes is walking up and down in the field outside,\u201d said\r\n      he. \u201cHe wants us all four to go up to the house together.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTo Mr. Cunningham\u2019s?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, sir.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat for?\u201d\r\n\r\n      The Inspector shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI don\u2019t quite know, sir.\r\n      Between ourselves, I think Mr. Holmes had not quite got over his\r\n      illness yet. He\u2019s been behaving very queerly, and he is very much\r\n      excited.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI don\u2019t think you need alarm yourself,\u201d said I. \u201cI have usually\r\n      found that there was method in his madness.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSome folks might say there was madness in his method,\u201d muttered\r\n      the Inspector. \u201cBut he\u2019s all on fire to start, Colonel, so we had\r\n      best go out if you are ready.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We found Holmes pacing up and down in the field, his chin sunk\r\n      upon his breast, and his hands thrust into his trousers pockets.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe matter grows in interest,\u201d said he. \u201cWatson, your\r\n      country-trip has been a distinct success. I have had a charming\r\n      morning.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou have been up to the scene of the crime, I understand,\u201d said\r\n      the Colonel.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes; the Inspector and I have made quite a little reconnaissance\r\n      together.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAny success?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, we have seen some very interesting things. I\u2019ll tell you\r\n      what we did as we walk. First of all, we saw the body of this\r\n      unfortunate man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as\r\n      reported.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHad you doubted it, then?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, it is as well to test everything. Our inspection was not\r\n      wasted. We then had an interview with Mr. Cunningham and his son,\r\n      who were able to point out the exact spot where the murderer had\r\n      broken through the garden-hedge in his flight. That was of great\r\n      interest.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cNaturally.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen we had a look at this poor fellow\u2019s mother. We could get no\r\n      information from her, however, as she is very old and feeble.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd what is the result of your investigations?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe conviction that the crime is a very peculiar one. Perhaps\r\n      our visit now may do something to make it less obscure. I think\r\n      that we are both agreed, Inspector that the fragment of paper in\r\n      the dead man\u2019s hand, bearing, as it does, the very hour of his\r\n      death written upon it, is of extreme importance.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt should give a clue, Mr. Holmes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt _does_ give a clue. Whoever wrote that note was the man who\r\n      brought William Kirwan out of his bed at that hour. But where is\r\n      the rest of that sheet of paper?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI examined the ground carefully in the hope of finding it,\u201d said\r\n      the Inspector.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt was torn out of the dead man\u2019s hand. Why was some one so\r\n      anxious to get possession of it? Because it incriminated him. And\r\n      what would he do with it? Thrust it into his pocket, most likely,\r\n      never noticing that a corner of it had been left in the grip of\r\n      the corpse. If we could get the rest of that sheet it is obvious\r\n      that we should have gone a long way towards solving the mystery.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but how can we get at the criminal\u2019s pocket before we catch\r\n      the criminal?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, well, it was worth thinking over. Then there is another\r\n      obvious point. The note was sent to William. The man who wrote it\r\n      could not have taken it; otherwise, of course, he might have\r\n      delivered his own message by word of mouth. Who brought the note,\r\n      then? Or did it come through the post?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have made inquiries,\u201d said the Inspector. \u201cWilliam received a\r\n      letter by the afternoon post yesterday. The envelope was\r\n      destroyed by him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent!\u201d cried Holmes, clapping the Inspector on the back.\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ve seen the postman. It is a pleasure to work with you.\r\n      Well, here is the lodge, and if you will come up, Colonel, I will\r\n      show you the scene of the crime.\u201d\r\n\r\n      We passed the pretty cottage where the murdered man had lived,\r\n      and walked up an oak-lined avenue to the fine old Queen Anne\r\n      house, which bears the date of Malplaquet upon the lintel of the\r\n      door. Holmes and the Inspector led us round it until we came to\r\n      the side gate, which is separated by a stretch of garden from the\r\n      hedge which lines the road. A constable was standing at the\r\n      kitchen door.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThrow the door open, officer,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cNow, it was on\r\n      those stairs that young Mr. Cunningham stood and saw the two men\r\n      struggling just where we are. Old Mr. Cunningham was at that\r\n      window\u2014the second on the left\u2014and he saw the fellow get away just\r\n      to the left of that bush. Then Mr. Alec ran out and knelt beside\r\n      the wounded man. The ground is very hard, you see, and there are\r\n      no marks to guide us.\u201d As he spoke two men came down the garden\r\n      path, from round the angle of the house. The one was an elderly\r\n      man, with a strong, deep-lined, heavy-eyed face; the other a\r\n      dashing young fellow, whose bright, smiling expression and showy\r\n      dress were in strange contrast with the business which had\r\n      brought us there.\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill at it, then?\u201d said he to Holmes. \u201cI thought you Londoners\r\n      were never at fault. You don\u2019t seem to be so very quick, after\r\n      all.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAh, you must give us a little time,\u201d said Holmes good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ll want it,\u201d said young Alec Cunningham. \u201cWhy, I don\u2019t see\r\n      that we have any clue at all.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere\u2019s only one,\u201d answered the Inspector. \u201cWe thought that if\r\n      we could only find\u2014Good heavens, Mr. Holmes! What is the matter?\u201d\r\n\r\n      My poor friend\u2019s face had suddenly assumed the most dreadful\r\n      expression. His eyes rolled upwards, his features writhed in\r\n      agony, and with a suppressed groan he dropped on his face upon\r\n      the ground. Horrified at the suddenness and severity of the\r\n      attack, we carried him into the kitchen, where he lay back in a\r\n      large chair, and breathed heavily for some minutes. Finally, with\r\n      a shamefaced apology for his weakness, he rose once more.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWatson would tell you that I have only just recovered from a\r\n      severe illness,\u201d he explained. \u201cI am liable to these sudden\r\n      nervous attacks.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cShall I send you home in my trap?\u201d asked old Cunningham.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, since I am here, there is one point on which I should like\r\n      to feel sure. We can very easily verify it.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhat was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, it seems to me that it is just possible that the arrival\r\n      of this poor fellow William was not before, but after, the\r\n      entrance of the burglar into the house. You appear to take it for\r\n      granted that, although the door was forced, the robber never got\r\n      in.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI fancy that is quite obvious,\u201d said Mr. Cunningham, gravely.\r\n      \u201cWhy, my son Alec had not yet gone to bed, and he would certainly\r\n      have heard any one moving about.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere was he sitting?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI was smoking in my dressing-room.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhich window is that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe last on the left next my father\u2019s.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBoth of your lamps were lit, of course?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cUndoubtedly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere are some very singular points here,\u201d said Holmes, smiling.\r\n      \u201cIs it not extraordinary that a burglar\u2014and a burglar who had had\r\n      some previous experience\u2014should deliberately break into a house\r\n      at a time when he could see from the lights that two of the\r\n      family were still afoot?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHe must have been a cool hand.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, of course, if the case were not an odd one we should not\r\n      have been driven to ask you for an explanation,\u201d said young Mr.\r\n      Alec. \u201cBut as to your ideas that the man had robbed the house\r\n      before William tackled him, I think it a most absurd notion.\r\n      Wouldn\u2019t we have found the place disarranged, and missed the\r\n      things which he had taken?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt depends on what the things were,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cYou must\r\n      remember that we are dealing with a burglar who is a very\r\n      peculiar fellow, and who appears to work on lines of his own.\r\n      Look, for example, at the queer lot of things which he took from\r\n      Acton\u2019s\u2014what was it?\u2014a ball of string, a letter-weight, and I\r\n      don\u2019t know what other odds and ends.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWell, we are quite in your hands, Mr. Holmes,\u201d said old\r\n      Cunningham. \u201cAnything which you or the Inspector may suggest will\r\n      most certainly be done.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIn the first place,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cI should like you to offer a\r\n      reward\u2014coming from yourself, for the officials may take a little\r\n      time before they would agree upon the sum, and these things\r\n      cannot be done too promptly. I have jotted down the form here, if\r\n      you would not mind signing it. Fifty pounds was quite enough, I\r\n      thought.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI would willingly give five hundred,\u201d said the J.P., taking the\r\n      slip of paper and the pencil which Holmes handed to him. \u201cThis is\r\n      not quite correct, however,\u201d he added, glancing over the\r\n      document.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wrote it rather hurriedly.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou see you begin, \u2018Whereas, at about a quarter to one on\r\n      Tuesday morning an attempt was made,\u2019 and so on. It was at a\r\n      quarter to twelve, as a matter of fact.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I was pained at the mistake, for I knew how keenly Holmes would\r\n      feel any slip of the kind. It was his specialty to be accurate as\r\n      to fact, but his recent illness had shaken him, and this one\r\n      little incident was enough to show me that he was still far from\r\n      being himself. He was obviously embarrassed for an instant, while\r\n      the Inspector raised his eyebrows, and Alec Cunningham burst into\r\n      a laugh. The old gentleman corrected the mistake, however, and\r\n      handed the paper back to Holmes.\r\n\r\n      \u201cGet it printed as soon as possible,\u201d he said; \u201cI think your idea\r\n      is an excellent one.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes put the slip of paper carefully away into his pocket-book.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now,\u201d said he, \u201cit really would be a good thing that we\r\n      should all go over the house together and make certain that this\r\n      rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away\r\n      with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Before entering, Holmes made an examination of the door which had\r\n      been forced. It was evident that a chisel or strong knife had\r\n      been thrust in, and the lock forced back with it. We could see\r\n      the marks in the wood where it had been pushed in.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t use bars, then?\u201d he asked.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe have never found it necessary.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou don\u2019t keep a dog?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes, but he is chained on the other side of the house.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhen do the servants go to bed?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAbout ten.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI understand that William was usually in bed also at that hour.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYes.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is singular that on this particular night he should have been\r\n      up. Now, I should be very glad if you would have the kindness to\r\n      show us over the house, Mr. Cunningham.\u201d\r\n\r\n      A stone-flagged passage, with the kitchens branching away from\r\n      it, led by a wooden staircase directly to the first floor of the\r\n      house. It came out upon the landing opposite to a second more\r\n      ornamental stair which came up from the front hall. Out of this\r\n      landing opened the drawing-room and several bedrooms, including\r\n      those of Mr. Cunningham and his son. Holmes walked slowly, taking\r\n      keen note of the architecture of the house. I could tell from his\r\n      expression that he was on a hot scent, and yet I could not in the\r\n      least imagine in what direction his inferences were leading him.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy good sir,\u201d said Mr. Cunningham with some impatience, \u201cthis is\r\n      surely very unnecessary. That is my room at the end of the\r\n      stairs, and my son\u2019s is the one beyond it. I leave it to your\r\n      judgment whether it was possible for the thief to have come up\r\n      here without disturbing us.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou must try round and get on a fresh scent, I fancy,\u201d said the\r\n      son with a rather malicious smile.\r\n\r\n      \u201cStill, I must ask you to humour me a little further. I should\r\n      like, for example, to see how far the windows of the bedrooms\r\n      command the front. This, I understand is your son\u2019s room\u201d\u2014he\r\n      pushed open the door\u2014\u201cand that, I presume, is the dressing-room\r\n      in which he sat smoking when the alarm was given. Where does the\r\n      window of that look out to?\u201d He stepped across the bedroom,\r\n      pushed open the door, and glanced round the other chamber.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI hope that you are satisfied now?\u201d said Mr. Cunningham, tartly.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThank you, I think I have seen all that I wished.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThen if it is really necessary we can go into my room.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIf it is not too much trouble.\u201d\r\n\r\n      The J.P. shrugged his shoulders, and led the way into his own\r\n      chamber, which was a plainly furnished and commonplace room. As\r\n      we moved across it in the direction of the window, Holmes fell\r\n      back until he and I were the last of the group. Near the foot of\r\n      the bed stood a dish of oranges and a carafe of water. As we\r\n      passed it Holmes, to my unutterable astonishment, leaned over in\r\n      front of me and deliberately knocked the whole thing over. The\r\n      glass smashed into a thousand pieces and the fruit rolled about\r\n      into every corner of the room.\r\n\r\n      \u201cYou\u2019ve done it now, Watson,\u201d said he, coolly. \u201cA pretty mess\r\n      you\u2019ve made of the carpet.\u201d\r\n\r\n      I stooped in some confusion and began to pick up the fruit,\r\n      understanding for some reason my companion desired me to take the\r\n      blame upon myself. The others did the same, and set the table on\r\n      its legs again.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHalloa!\u201d cried the Inspector, \u201cwhere\u2019s he got to?\u201d\r\n\r\n      Holmes had disappeared.\r\n\r\n      \u201cWait here an instant,\u201d said young Alec Cunningham. \u201cThe fellow\r\n      is off his head, in my opinion. Come with me, father, and see\r\n      where he has got to!\u201d\r\n\r\n      They rushed out of the room, leaving the Inspector, the Colonel,\r\n      and me staring at each other.\r\n\r\n      \u201c\u2019Pon my word, I am inclined to agree with Master Alec,\u201d said the\r\n      official. \u201cIt may be the effect of this illness, but it seems to\r\n      me that\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      His words were cut short by a sudden scream of \u201cHelp! Help!\r\n      Murder!\u201d With a thrill I recognised the voice of that of my\r\n      friend. I rushed madly from the room on to the landing. The\r\n      cries, which had sunk down into a hoarse, inarticulate shouting,\r\n      came from the room which we had first visited. I dashed in, and\r\n      on into the dressing-room beyond. The two Cunninghams were\r\n      bending over the prostrate figure of Sherlock Holmes, the younger\r\n      clutching his throat with both hands, while the elder seemed to\r\n      be twisting one of his wrists. In an instant the three of us had\r\n      torn them away from him, and Holmes staggered to his feet, very\r\n      pale and evidently greatly exhausted.\r\n\r\n      \u201cArrest these men, Inspector!\u201d he gasped.\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn what charge?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThat of murdering their coachman, William Kirwan!\u201d\r\n\r\n      The Inspector stared about him in bewilderment. \u201cOh, come now,\r\n      Mr. Holmes,\u201d said he at last, \u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t really mean\r\n      to\u2014\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cTut, man, look at their faces!\u201d cried Holmes, curtly.\r\n\r\n      Never, certainly, have I seen a plainer confession of guilt upon\r\n      human countenances. The older man seemed numbed and dazed with a\r\n      heavy, sullen expression upon his strongly-marked face. The son,\r\n      on the other hand, had dropped all that jaunty, dashing style\r\n      which had characterized him, and the ferocity of a dangerous wild\r\n      beast gleamed in his dark eyes and distorted his handsome\r\n      features. The Inspector said nothing, but, stepping to the door,\r\n      he blew his whistle. Two of his constables came at the call.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI have no alternative, Mr. Cunningham,\u201d said he. \u201cI trust that\r\n      this may all prove to be an absurd mistake, but you can see\r\n      that\u2014Ah, would you? Drop it!\u201d He struck out with his hand, and a\r\n      revolver which the younger man was in the act of cocking\r\n      clattered down upon the floor.\r\n\r\n      \u201cKeep that,\u201d said Holmes, quietly putting his foot upon it; \u201cyou\r\n      will find it useful at the trial. But this is what we really\r\n      wanted.\u201d He held up a little crumpled piece of paper.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe remainder of the sheet!\u201d cried the Inspector.\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd where was it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWhere I was sure it must be. I\u2019ll make the whole matter clear to\r\n      you presently. I think, Colonel, that you and Watson might return\r\n      now, and I will be with you again in an hour at the furthest. The\r\n      Inspector and I must have a word with the prisoners, but you will\r\n      certainly see me back at luncheon time.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes was as good as his word, for about one o\u2019clock he\r\n      rejoined us in the Colonel\u2019s smoking-room. He was accompanied by\r\n      a little elderly gentleman, who was introduced to me as the Mr.\r\n      Acton whose house had been the scene of the original burglary.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI wished Mr. Acton to be present while I demonstrated this small\r\n      matter to you,\u201d said Holmes, \u201cfor it is natural that he should\r\n      take a keen interest in the details. I am afraid, my dear\r\n      Colonel, that you must regret the hour that you took in such a\r\n      stormy petrel as I am.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOn the contrary,\u201d answered the Colonel, warmly, \u201cI consider it\r\n      the greatest privilege to have been permitted to study your\r\n      methods of working. I confess that they quite surpass my\r\n      expectations, and that I am utterly unable to account for your\r\n      result. I have not yet seen the vestige of a clue.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI am afraid that my explanation may disillusionize you but it\r\n      has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from\r\n      my friend Watson or from any one who might take an intelligent\r\n      interest in them. But, first, as I am rather shaken by the\r\n      knocking about which I had in the dressing-room, I think that I\r\n      shall help myself to a dash of your brandy, Colonel. My strength\r\n      has been rather tried of late.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cI trust that you had no more of those nervous attacks.\u201d\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes laughed heartily. \u201cWe will come to that in its\r\n      turn,\u201d said he. \u201cI will lay an account of the case before you in\r\n      its due order, showing you the various points which guided me in\r\n      my decision. Pray interrupt me if there is any inference which is\r\n      not perfectly clear to you.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is of the highest importance in the art of detection to be\r\n      able to recognise, out of a number of facts, which are incidental\r\n      and which vital. Otherwise your energy and attention must be\r\n      dissipated instead of being concentrated. Now, in this case there\r\n      was not the slightest doubt in my mind from the first that the\r\n      key of the whole matter must be looked for in the scrap of paper\r\n      in the dead man\u2019s hand.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBefore going into this, I would draw your attention to the fact\r\n      that, if Alec Cunningham\u2019s narrative was correct, and if the\r\n      assailant, after shooting William Kirwan, had _instantly_ fled,\r\n      then it obviously could not be he who tore the paper from the\r\n      dead man\u2019s hand. But if it was not he, it must have been Alec\r\n      Cunningham himself, for by the time that the old man had\r\n      descended several servants were upon the scene. The point is a\r\n      simple one, but the Inspector had overlooked it because he had\r\n      started with the supposition that these county magnates had had\r\n      nothing to do with the matter. Now, I make a point of never\r\n      having any prejudices, and of following docilely wherever fact\r\n      may lead me, and so, in the very first stage of the\r\n      investigation, I found myself looking a little askance at the\r\n      part which had been played by Mr. Alec Cunningham.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now I made a very careful examination of the corner of paper\r\n      which the Inspector had submitted to us. It was at once clear to\r\n      me that it formed part of a very remarkable document. Here it is.\r\n      Do you not now observe something very suggestive about it?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt has a very irregular look,\u201d said the Colonel.\r\n\r\n      \u201cMy dear sir,\u201d cried Holmes, \u201cthere cannot be the least doubt in\r\n      the world that it has been written by two persons doing alternate\r\n      words. When I draw your attention to the strong t\u2019s of \u2018at\u2019 and\r\n      \u2018to\u2019, and ask you to compare them with the weak ones of \u2018quarter\u2019\r\n      and \u2018twelve,\u2019 you will instantly recognise the fact. A very brief\r\n      analysis of these four words would enable you to say with the\r\n      utmost confidence that the \u2018learn\u2019 and the \u2018maybe\u2019 are written in\r\n      the stronger hand, and the \u2018what\u2019 in the weaker.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cBy Jove, it\u2019s as clear as day!\u201d cried the Colonel. \u201cWhy on earth\r\n      should two men write a letter in such a fashion?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cObviously the business was a bad one, and one of the men who\r\n      distrusted the other was determined that, whatever was done, each\r\n      should have an equal hand in it. Now, of the two men, it is clear\r\n      that the one who wrote the \u2018at\u2019 and \u2018to\u2019 was the ringleader.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cHow do you get at that?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cWe might deduce it from the mere character of the one hand as\r\n      compared with the other. But we have more assured reasons than\r\n      that for supposing it. If you examine this scrap with attention\r\n      you will come to the conclusion that the man with the stronger\r\n      hand wrote all his words first, leaving blanks for the other to\r\n      fill up. These blanks were not always sufficient, and you can see\r\n      that the second man had a squeeze to fit his \u2018quarter\u2019 in between\r\n      the \u2018at\u2019 and the \u2018to,\u2019 showing that the latter were already\r\n      written. The man who wrote all his words first is undoubtedly the\r\n      man who planned the affair.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent!\u201d cried Mr. Acton.\r\n\r\n      \u201cBut very superficial,\u201d said Holmes. \u201cWe come now, however, to a\r\n      point which is of importance. You may not be aware that the\r\n      deduction of a man\u2019s age from his writing is one which has been\r\n      brought to considerable accuracy by experts. In normal cases one\r\n      can place a man in his true decade with tolerable confidence. I\r\n      say normal cases, because ill-health and physical weakness\r\n      reproduce the signs of old age, even when the invalid is a youth.\r\n      In this case, looking at the bold, strong hand of the one, and\r\n      the rather broken-backed appearance of the other, which still\r\n      retains its legibility although the t\u2019s have begun to lose their\r\n      crossing, we can say that the one was a young man and the other\r\n      was advanced in years without being positively decrepit.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cExcellent!\u201d cried Mr. Acton again.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere is a further point, however, which is subtler and of\r\n      greater interest. There is something in common between these\r\n      hands. They belong to men who are blood-relatives. It may be most\r\n      obvious to you in the Greek e\u2019s, but to me there are many small\r\n      points which indicate the same thing. I have no doubt at all that\r\n      a family mannerism can be traced in these two specimens of\r\n      writing. I am only, of course, giving you the leading results now\r\n      of my examination of the paper. There were twenty-three other\r\n      deductions which would be of more interest to experts than to\r\n      you. They all tend to deepen the impression upon my mind that the\r\n      Cunninghams, father and son, had written this letter.\r\n\r\n      \u201cHaving got so far, my next step was, of course, to examine into\r\n      the details of the crime, and to see how far they would help us.\r\n      I went up to the house with the Inspector, and saw all that was\r\n      to be seen. The wound upon the dead man was, as I was able to\r\n      determine with absolute confidence, fired from a revolver at the\r\n      distance of something over four yards. There was no\r\n      powder-blackening on the clothes. Evidently, therefore, Alec\r\n      Cunningham had lied when he said that the two men were struggling\r\n      when the shot was fired. Again, both father and son agreed as to\r\n      the place where the man escaped into the road. At that point,\r\n      however, as it happens, there is a broadish ditch, moist at the\r\n      bottom. As there were no indications of bootmarks about this\r\n      ditch, I was absolutely sure not only that the Cunninghams had\r\n      again lied, but that there had never been any unknown man upon\r\n      the scene at all.\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd now I have to consider the motive of this singular crime. To\r\n      get at this, I endeavoured first of all to solve the reason of\r\n      the original burglary at Mr. Acton\u2019s. I understood, from\r\n      something which the Colonel told us, that a lawsuit had been\r\n      going on between you, Mr. Acton, and the Cunninghams. Of course,\r\n      it instantly occurred to me that they had broken into your\r\n      library with the intention of getting at some document which\r\n      might be of importance in the case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cPrecisely so,\u201d said Mr. Acton. \u201cThere can be no possible doubt\r\n      as to their intentions. I have the clearest claim upon half of\r\n      their present estate, and if they could have found a single\r\n      paper\u2014which, fortunately, was in the strong-box of my\r\n      solicitors\u2014they would undoubtedly have crippled our case.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cThere you are,\u201d said Holmes, smiling. \u201cIt was a dangerous,\r\n      reckless attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young\r\n      Alec. Having found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by\r\n      making it appear to be an ordinary burglary, to which end they\r\n      carried off whatever they could lay their hands upon. That is all\r\n      clear enough, but there was much that was still obscure. What I\r\n      wanted above all was to get the missing part of that note. I was\r\n      certain that Alec had torn it out of the dead man\u2019s hand, and\r\n      almost certain that he must have thrust it into the pocket of his\r\n      dressing-gown. Where else could he have put it? The only question\r\n      was whether it was still there. It was worth an effort to find\r\n      out, and for that object we all went up to the house.\r\n\r\n      \u201cThe Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside\r\n      the kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance\r\n      that they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper,\r\n      otherwise they would naturally destroy it without delay. The\r\n      Inspector was about to tell them the importance which we attached\r\n      to it when, by the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down\r\n      in a sort of fit and so changed the conversation.\r\n\r\n      \u201cGood heavens!\u201d cried the Colonel, laughing, \u201cdo you mean to say\r\n      all our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cSpeaking professionally, it was admirably done,\u201d cried I,\r\n      looking in amazement at this man who was forever confounding me\r\n      with some new phase of his astuteness.\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is an art which is often useful,\u201d said he. \u201cWhen I recovered\r\n      I managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of\r\n      ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word \u2018twelve,\u2019 so\r\n      that I might compare it with the \u2018twelve\u2019 upon the paper.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cOh, what an ass I have been!\u201d I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI could see that you were commiserating me over my weakness,\u201d\r\n      said Holmes, laughing. \u201cI was sorry to cause you the sympathetic\r\n      pain which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together,\r\n      and having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up\r\n      behind the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage\r\n      their attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the\r\n      pockets. I had hardly got the paper, however\u2014which was, as I had\r\n      expected, in one of them\u2014when the two Cunninghams were on me, and\r\n      would, I verily believe, have murdered me then and there but for\r\n      your prompt and friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man\u2019s\r\n      grip on my throat now, and the father has twisted my wrist round\r\n      in the effort to get the paper out of my hand. They saw that I\r\n      must know all about it, you see, and the sudden change from\r\n      absolute security to complete despair made them perfectly\r\n      desperate.\r\n\r\n      \u201cI had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the\r\n      motive of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was\r\n      a perfect demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else\u2019s\r\n      brains if he could have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw\r\n      that the case against him was so strong he lost all heart and\r\n      made a clean breast of everything. It seems that William had\r\n      secretly followed his two masters on the night when they made\r\n      their raid upon Mr. Acton\u2019s, and having thus got them into his\r\n      power, proceeded, under threats of exposure, to levy blackmail\r\n      upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a dangerous man to play games\r\n      of that sort with. It was a stroke of positive genius on his part\r\n      to see in the burglary scare which was convulsing the country\r\n      side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid of the man whom he\r\n      feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had they only got\r\n      the whole of the note and paid a little more attention to detail\r\n      in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion might\r\n      never have been aroused.\u201d\r\n\r\n      \u201cAnd the note?\u201d I asked.\r\n\r\n      Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.\r\npiece of paper\r\n\r\n     If you will only come round at quarter to twelve\r\n     to the east gate you will learn what\r\n     will very much surprise you and maybe\r\n     be of the greatest service to you and also\r\n     to Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone\r\n     upon the matter\r\n\r\n      \u201cIt is very much the sort of thing that I expected,\u201d said he. \u201cOf\r\n      course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been\r\n      between Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The\r\n      results shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that\r\n      you cannot fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown\r\n      in the p\u2019s and in the tails of the g\u2019s. The absence of the i-dots\r\n      in the old man\u2019s writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I\r\n      think our quiet rest in the country has been a distinct success,\r\n      and I shall certainly return much invigorated to Baker Street\r\n      to-morrow.\u201d\r\n", "The Adventure of the Dancing Men": "HOLMES had been seated for some hours in silence with his long,\r\nthin back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a\r\nparticularly malodorous product. His head was sunk upon his breast, and\r\nhe looked from my point of view like a strange, lank bird, with dull\r\ngrey plumage and a black top-knot.\r\n\r\n\"So, Watson,\" said he, suddenly, \"you do not propose to invest in South\r\nAfrican securities?\"\r\n\r\nI gave a start of astonishment. Accustomed as I was to Holmes's curious\r\nfaculties, this sudden intrusion into my most intimate thoughts was\r\nutterly inexplicable.\r\n\r\n\"How on earth do you know that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe wheeled round upon his stool, with a steaming test-tube in his hand\r\nand a gleam of amusement in his deep-set eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Watson, confess yourself utterly taken aback,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because in five minutes you will say that it is all so absurdly\r\nsimple.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that I shall say nothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, my dear Watson\"--he propped his test-tube in the rack and\r\nbegan to lecture with the air of a professor addressing his class--\"it\r\nis not really difficult to construct a series of inferences, each\r\ndependent upon its predecessor and each simple in itself. If, after\r\ndoing so, one simply knocks out all the central inferences and presents\r\none's audience with the starting-point and the conclusion, one may\r\nproduce a startling, though possibly a meretricious, effect. Now, it was\r\nnot really difficult, by an inspection of the groove between your left\r\nforefinger and thumb, to feel sure that you did NOT propose to invest\r\nyour small capital in the goldfields.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see no connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely not; but I can quickly show you a close connection. Here\r\nare the missing links of the very simple chain: 1. You had chalk between\r\nyour left finger and thumb when you returned from the club last night.\r\n2. You put chalk there when you play billiards to steady the cue. 3. You\r\nnever play billiards except with Thurston. 4. You told me four weeks ago\r\nthat Thurston had an option on some South African property which would\r\nexpire in a month, and which he desired you to share with him. 5. Your\r\ncheque-book is locked in my drawer, and you have not asked for the key.\r\n6. You do not propose to invest your money in this manner.\"\r\n\r\n\"How absurdly simple!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Quite so!\" said he, a little nettled. \"Every problem becomes very\r\nchildish when once it is explained to you. Here is an unexplained one.\r\nSee what you can make of that, friend Watson.\" He tossed a sheet of\r\npaper upon the table and turned once more to his chemical analysis.\r\n\r\nI looked with amazement at the absurd hieroglyphics upon the paper.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Holmes, it is a child's drawing,\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's your idea!\"\r\n\r\n\"What else should it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what Mr. Hilton Cubitt, of Riding Thorpe Manor, Norfolk, is\r\nvery anxious to know. This little conundrum came by the first post, and\r\nhe was to follow by the next train. There's a ring at the bell, Watson.\r\nI should not be very much surprised if this were he.\"\r\n\r\nA heavy step was heard upon the stairs, and an instant later there\r\nentered a tall, ruddy, clean-shaven gentleman, whose clear eyes and\r\nflorid cheeks told of a life led far from the fogs of Baker Street. He\r\nseemed to bring a whiff of his strong, fresh, bracing, east-coast air\r\nwith him as he entered. Having shaken hands with each of us, he was\r\nabout to sit down when his eye rested upon the paper with the curious\r\nmarkings, which I had just examined and left upon the table.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Holmes, what do you make of these?\" he cried. \"They told me\r\nthat you were fond of queer mysteries, and I don't think you can find a\r\nqueerer one than that. I sent the paper on ahead so that you might have\r\ntime to study it before I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly rather a curious production,\" said Holmes. \"At first\r\nsight it would appear to be some childish prank. It consists of a number\r\nof absurd little figures dancing across the paper upon which they\r\nare drawn. Why should you attribute any importance to so grotesque an\r\nobject?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never should, Mr. Holmes. But my wife does. It is frightening her to\r\ndeath. She says nothing, but I can see terror in her eyes. That's why I\r\nwant to sift the matter to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was\r\na page torn from a note-book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran\r\nin this way:--\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC\r\n\r\nHolmes examined it for some time, and then, folding it carefully up, he\r\nplaced it in his pocket-book.\r\n\r\n\"This promises to be a most interesting and unusual case,\" said he.\r\n\"You gave me a few particulars in your letter, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, but I\r\nshould be very much obliged if you would kindly go over it all again for\r\nthe benefit of my friend, Dr. Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not much of a story-teller,\" said our visitor, nervously clasping\r\nand unclasping his great, strong hands. \"You'll just ask me anything\r\nthat I don't make clear. I'll begin at the time of my marriage last\r\nyear; but I want to say first of all that, though I'm not a rich man, my\r\npeople have been at Ridling Thorpe for a matter of five centuries, and\r\nthere is no better known family in the County of Norfolk. Last year I\r\ncame up to London for the Jubilee, and I stopped at a boarding-house in\r\nRussell Square, because Parker, the vicar of our parish, was staying in\r\nit. There was an American young lady there--Patrick was the name--Elsie\r\nPatrick. In some way we became friends, until before my month was up\r\nI was as much in love as a man could be. We were quietly married at\r\na registry office, and we returned to Norfolk a wedded couple. You'll\r\nthink it very mad, Mr. Holmes, that a man of a good old family should\r\nmarry a wife in this fashion, knowing nothing of her past or of her\r\npeople; but if you saw her and knew her it would help you to understand.\r\n\r\n\"She was very straight about it, was Elsie. I can't say that she did not\r\ngive me every chance of getting out of it if I wished to do so. 'I have\r\nhad some very disagreeable associations in my life,' said she; 'I wish\r\nto forget all about them. I would rather never allude to the past, for\r\nit is very painful to me. If you take me, Hilton, you will take a woman\r\nwho has nothing that she need be personally ashamed of; but you will\r\nhave to be content with my word for it, and to allow me to be silent\r\nas to all that passed up to the time when I became yours. If these\r\nconditions are too hard, then go back to Norfolk and leave me to the\r\nlonely life in which you found me.' It was only the day before our\r\nwedding that she said those very words to me. I told her that I was\r\ncontent to take her on her own terms, and I have been as good as my\r\nword.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have been married now for a year, and very happy we have been.\r\nBut about a month ago, at the end of June, I saw for the first time\r\nsigns of trouble. One day my wife received a letter from America. I saw\r\nthe American stamp. She turned deadly white, read the letter, and threw\r\nit into the fire. She made no allusion to it afterwards, and I made\r\nnone, for a promise is a promise; but she has never known an easy hour\r\nfrom that moment. There is always a look of fear upon her face--a look\r\nas if she were waiting and expecting. She would do better to trust me.\r\nShe would find that I was her best friend. But until she speaks I can\r\nsay nothing. Mind you, she is a truthful woman, Mr. Holmes, and whatever\r\ntrouble there may have been in her past life it has been no fault of\r\nhers. I am only a simple Norfolk squire, but there is not a man in\r\nEngland who ranks his family honour more highly than I do. She knows it\r\nwell, and she knew it well before she married me. She would never bring\r\nany stain upon it--of that I am sure.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now I come to the queer part of my story. About a week ago--it\r\nwas the Tuesday of last week--I found on one of the window-sills a\r\nnumber of absurd little dancing figures, like these upon the paper. They\r\nwere scrawled with chalk. I thought that it was the stable-boy who had\r\ndrawn them, but the lad swore he knew nothing about it. Anyhow, they had\r\ncome there during the night. I had them washed out, and I only mentioned\r\nthe matter to my wife afterwards. To my surprise she took it very\r\nseriously, and begged me if any more came to let her see them. None did\r\ncome for a week, and then yesterday morning I found this paper lying on\r\nthe sun-dial in the garden. I showed it to Elsie, and down she dropped\r\nin a dead faint. Since then she has looked like a woman in a dream, half\r\ndazed, and with terror always lurking in her eyes. It was then that I\r\nwrote and sent the paper to you, Mr. Holmes. It was not a thing that\r\nI could take to the police, for they would have laughed at me, but you\r\nwill tell me what to do. I am not a rich man; but if there is any danger\r\nthreatening my little woman I would spend my last copper to shield her.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a fine creature, this man of the old English soil, simple,\r\nstraight, and gentle, with his great, earnest blue eyes and broad,\r\ncomely face. His love for his wife and his trust in her shone in his\r\nfeatures. Holmes had listened to his story with the utmost attention,\r\nand now he sat for some time in silent thought.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think, Mr. Cubitt,\" said he, at last, \"that your best plan\r\nwould be to make a direct appeal to your wife, and to ask her to share\r\nher secret with you?\"\r\n\r\nHilton Cubitt shook his massive head.\r\n\r\n\"A promise is a promise, Mr. Holmes. If Elsie wished to tell me she\r\nwould. If not, it is not for me to force her confidence. But I am\r\njustified in taking my own line--and I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will help you with all my heart. In the first place, have you\r\nheard of any strangers being seen in your neighbourhood?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"I presume that it is a very quiet place. Any fresh face would cause\r\ncomment?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the immediate neighbourhood, yes. But we have several small\r\nwatering-places not very far away. And the farmers take in lodgers.\"\r\n\r\n\"These hieroglyphics have evidently a meaning. If it is a purely\r\narbitrary one it may be impossible for us to solve it. If, on the other\r\nhand, it is systematic, I have no doubt that we shall get to the bottom\r\nof it. But this particular sample is so short that I can do nothing, and\r\nthe facts which you have brought me are so indefinite that we have no\r\nbasis for an investigation. I would suggest that you return to Norfolk,\r\nthat you keep a keen look-out, and that you take an exact copy of any\r\nfresh dancing men which may appear. It is a thousand pities that we\r\nhave not a reproduction of those which were done in chalk upon the\r\nwindow-sill. Make a discreet inquiry also as to any strangers in the\r\nneighbourhood. When you have collected some fresh evidence come to me\r\nagain. That is the best advice which I can give you, Mr. Hilton Cubitt.\r\nIf there are any pressing fresh developments I shall be always ready to\r\nrun down and see you in your Norfolk home.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview left Sherlock Holmes very thoughtful, and several times\r\nin the next few days I saw him take his slip of paper from his note-book\r\nand look long and earnestly at the curious figures inscribed upon it. He\r\nmade no allusion to the affair, however, until one afternoon a fortnight\r\nor so later. I was going out when he called me back.\r\n\r\n\"You had better stay here, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I had a wire from Hilton Cubitt this morning--you remember\r\nHilton Cubitt, of the dancing men? He was to reach Liverpool Street at\r\none-twenty. He may be here at any moment. I gather from his wire that\r\nthere have been some new incidents of importance.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not long to wait, for our Norfolk squire came straight from the\r\nstation as fast as a hansom could bring him. He was looking worried and\r\ndepressed, with tired eyes and a lined forehead.\r\n\r\n\"It's getting on my nerves, this business, Mr. Holmes,\" said he, as he\r\nsank, like a wearied man, into an arm-chair. \"It's bad enough to feel\r\nthat you are surrounded by unseen, unknown folk, who have some kind of\r\ndesign upon you; but when, in addition to that, you know that it is just\r\nkilling your wife by inches, then it becomes as much as flesh and blood\r\ncan endure. She's wearing away under it--just wearing away before my\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Has she said anything yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, she has not. And yet there have been times when the\r\npoor girl has wanted to speak, and yet could not quite bring herself\r\nto take the plunge. I have tried to help her; but I dare say I did\r\nit clumsily, and scared her off from it. She has spoken about my old\r\nfamily, and our reputation in the county, and our pride in our unsullied\r\nhonour, and I always felt it was leading to the point; but somehow it\r\nturned off before we got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have found out something for yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"A good deal, Mr. Holmes. I have several fresh dancing men pictures for\r\nyou to examine, and, what is more important, I have seen the fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the man who draws them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I saw him at his work. But I will tell you everything in order.\r\nWhen I got back after my visit to you, the very first thing I saw next\r\nmorning was a fresh crop of dancing men. They had been drawn in chalk\r\nupon the black wooden door of the tool-house, which stands beside the\r\nlawn in full view of the front windows. I took an exact copy, and here\r\nit is.\" He unfolded a paper and laid it upon the table. Here is a copy\r\nof the hieroglyphics:--\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC\r\n\r\n\"Excellent!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent! Pray continue.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I had taken the copy I rubbed out the marks; but two mornings\r\nlater a fresh inscription had appeared. I have a copy of it here\":--\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC\r\n\r\nHolmes rubbed his hands and chuckled with delight.\r\n\r\n\"Our material is rapidly accumulating,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Three days later a message was left scrawled upon paper, and placed\r\nunder a pebble upon the sun-dial. Here it is. The characters are, as you\r\nsee, exactly the same as the last one. After that I determined to lie in\r\nwait; so I got out my revolver and I sat up in my study, which overlooks\r\nthe lawn and garden. About two in the morning I was seated by the\r\nwindow, all being dark save for the moonlight outside, when I heard\r\nsteps behind me, and there was my wife in her dressing-gown. She\r\nimplored me to come to bed. I told her frankly that I wished to see who\r\nit was who played such absurd tricks upon us. She answered that it was\r\nsome senseless practical joke, and that I should not take any notice of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"'If it really annoys you, Hilton, we might go and travel, you and I,\r\nand so avoid this nuisance.'\r\n\r\n\"'What, be driven out of our own house by a practical joker?' said I.\r\n'Why, we should have the whole county laughing at us.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, come to bed,' said she, 'and we can discuss it in the morning.'\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly, as she spoke, I saw her white face grow whiter yet in the\r\nmoonlight, and her hand tightened upon my shoulder. Something was moving\r\nin the shadow of the tool-house. I saw a dark, creeping figure which\r\ncrawled round the corner and squatted in front of the door. Seizing my\r\npistol I was rushing out, when my wife threw her arms round me and held\r\nme with convulsive strength. I tried to throw her off, but she clung to\r\nme most desperately. At last I got clear, but by the time I had opened\r\nthe door and reached the house the creature was gone. He had left a\r\ntrace of his presence, however, for there on the door was the very same\r\narrangement of dancing men which had already twice appeared, and which\r\nI have copied on that paper. There was no other sign of the fellow\r\nanywhere, though I ran all over the grounds. And yet the amazing thing\r\nis that he must have been there all the time, for when I examined the\r\ndoor again in the morning he had scrawled some more of his pictures\r\nunder the line which I had already seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you that fresh drawing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it is very short, but I made a copy of it, and here it is.\"\r\n\r\nAgain he produced a paper. The new dance was in this form:--\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Holmes--and I could see by his eyes that he was much\r\nexcited--\"was this a mere addition to the first, or did it appear to be\r\nentirely separate?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was on a different panel of the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Excellent! This is far the most important of all for our purpose. It\r\nfills me with hopes. Now, Mr. Hilton Cubitt, please continue your most\r\ninteresting statement.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing more to say, Mr. Holmes, except that I was angry with\r\nmy wife that night for having held me back when I might have caught the\r\nskulking rascal. She said that she feared that I might come to harm. For\r\nan instant it had crossed my mind that perhaps what she really feared\r\nwas that HE might come to harm, for I could not doubt that she knew who\r\nthis man was and what he meant by these strange signals. But there is a\r\ntone in my wife's voice, Mr. Holmes, and a look in her eyes which forbid\r\ndoubt, and I am sure that it was indeed my own safety that was in her\r\nmind. There's the whole case, and now I want your advice as to what I\r\nought to do. My own inclination is to put half-a-dozen of my farm lads\r\nin the shrubbery, and when this fellow comes again to give him such a\r\nhiding that he will leave us in peace for the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear it is too deep a case for such simple remedies,\" said Holmes.\r\n\"How long can you stay in London?\"\r\n\r\n\"I must go back to-day. I would not leave my wife alone all night for\r\nanything. She is very nervous and begged me to come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you are right. But if you could have stopped I might\r\npossibly have been able to return with you in a day or two. Meanwhile\r\nyou will leave me these papers, and I think that it is very likely that\r\nI shall be able to pay you a visit shortly and to throw some light upon\r\nyour case.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes preserved his calm professional manner until our visitor\r\nhad left us, although it was easy for me, who knew him so well, to see\r\nthat he was profoundly excited. The moment that Hilton Cubitt's broad\r\nback had disappeared through the door my comrade rushed to the table,\r\nlaid out all the slips of paper containing dancing men in front of him,\r\nand threw himself into an intricate and elaborate calculation. For\r\ntwo hours I watched him as he covered sheet after sheet of paper with\r\nfigures and letters, so completely absorbed in his task that he had\r\nevidently forgotten my presence. Sometimes he was making progress and\r\nwhistled and sang at his work; sometimes he was puzzled, and would sit\r\nfor long spells with a furrowed brow and a vacant eye. Finally he sprang\r\nfrom his chair with a cry of satisfaction, and walked up and down the\r\nroom rubbing his hands together. Then he wrote a long telegram upon a\r\ncable form. \"If my answer to this is as I hope, you will have a very\r\npretty case to add to your collection, Watson,\" said he. \"I expect that\r\nwe shall be able to go down to Norfolk to-morrow, and to take our friend\r\nsome very definite news as to the secret of his annoyance.\"\r\n\r\nI confess that I was filled with curiosity, but I was aware that Holmes\r\nliked to make his disclosures at his own time and in his own way; so I\r\nwaited until it should suit him to take me into his confidence.\r\n\r\nBut there was a delay in that answering telegram, and two days of\r\nimpatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every\r\nring of the bell. On the evening of the second there came a letter from\r\nHilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that a long inscription had\r\nappeared that morning upon the pedestal of the sun-dial. He inclosed a\r\ncopy of it, which is here reproduced:--\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC\r\n\r\nHolmes bent over this grotesque frieze for some minutes, and then\r\nsuddenly sprang to his feet with an exclamation of surprise and dismay.\r\nHis face was haggard with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"We have let this affair go far enough,\" said he. \"Is there a train to\r\nNorth Walsham to-night?\"\r\n\r\nI turned up the time-table. The last had just gone.\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall breakfast early and take the very first in the morning,\"\r\nsaid Holmes. \"Our presence is most urgently needed. Ah! here is our\r\nexpected cablegram. One moment, Mrs. Hudson; there may be an answer. No,\r\nthat is quite as I expected. This message makes it even more essential\r\nthat we should not lose an hour in letting Hilton Cubitt know how\r\nmatters stand, for it is a singular and a dangerous web in which our\r\nsimple Norfolk squire is entangled.\"\r\n\r\nSo, indeed, it proved, and as I come to the dark conclusion of a story\r\nwhich had seemed to me to be only childish and bizarre I experience once\r\nagain the dismay and horror with which I was filled. Would that I had\r\nsome brighter ending to communicate to my readers, but these are the\r\nchronicles of fact, and I must follow to their dark crisis the strange\r\nchain of events which for some days made Ridling Thorpe Manor a\r\nhousehold word through the length and breadth of England.\r\n\r\nWe had hardly alighted at North Walsham, and mentioned the name of our\r\ndestination, when the station-master hurried towards us. \"I suppose that\r\nyou are the detectives from London?\" said he.\r\n\r\nA look of annoyance passed over Holmes's face.\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think such a thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Inspector Martin from Norwich has just passed through. But\r\nmaybe you are the surgeons. She's not dead--or wasn't by last accounts.\r\nYou may be in time to save her yet--though it be for the gallows.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes's brow was dark with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"We are going to Ridling Thorpe Manor,\" said he, \"but we have heard\r\nnothing of what has passed there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a terrible business,\" said the station-master. \"They are shot,\r\nboth Mr. Hilton Cubitt and his wife. She shot him and then herself--so\r\nthe servants say. He's dead and her life is despaired of. Dear, dear,\r\none of the oldest families in the County of Norfolk, and one of the most\r\nhonoured.\"\r\n\r\nWithout a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long seven\r\nmiles' drive he never opened his mouth. Seldom have I seen him so\r\nutterly despondent. He had been uneasy during all our journey from\r\ntown, and I had observed that he had turned over the morning papers with\r\nanxious attention; but now this sudden realization of his worst fears\r\nleft him in a blank melancholy. He leaned back in his seat, lost in\r\ngloomy speculation. Yet there was much around to interest us, for we\r\nwere passing through as singular a country-side as any in England, where\r\na few scattered cottages represented the population of to-day, while on\r\nevery hand enormous square-towered churches bristled up from the flat,\r\ngreen landscape and told of the glory and prosperity of old East Anglia.\r\nAt last the violet rim of the German Ocean appeared over the green edge\r\nof the Norfolk coast, and the driver pointed with his whip to two old\r\nbrick and timber gables which projected from a grove of trees. \"That's\r\nRidling Thorpe Manor,\" said he.\r\n\r\nAs we drove up to the porticoed front door I observed in front of\r\nit, beside the tennis lawn, the black tool-house and the pedestalled\r\nsun-dial with which we had such strange associations. A dapper little\r\nman, with a quick, alert manner and a waxed moustache, had just\r\ndescended from a high dog-cart. He introduced himself as Inspector\r\nMartin, of the Norfolk Constabulary, and he was considerably astonished\r\nwhen he heard the name of my companion.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Mr. Holmes, the crime was only committed at three this morning.\r\nHow could you hear of it in London and get to the spot as soon as I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I anticipated it. I came in the hope of preventing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must have important evidence of which we are ignorant, for\r\nthey were said to be a most united couple.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only the evidence of the dancing men,\" said Holmes. \"I will\r\nexplain the matter to you later. Meanwhile, since it is too late to\r\nprevent this tragedy, I am very anxious that I should use the knowledge\r\nwhich I possess in order to ensure that justice be done. Will you\r\nassociate me in your investigation, or will you prefer that I should act\r\nindependently?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be proud to feel that we were acting together, Mr. Holmes,\"\r\nsaid the inspector, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"In that case I should be glad to hear the evidence and to examine the\r\npremises without an instant of unnecessary delay.\"\r\n\r\nInspector Martin had the good sense to allow my friend to do things\r\nin his own fashion, and contented himself with carefully noting the\r\nresults. The local surgeon, an old, white-haired man, had just come down\r\nfrom Mrs. Hilton Cubitt's room, and he reported that her injuries were\r\nserious, but not necessarily fatal. The bullet had passed through the\r\nfront of her brain, and it would probably be some time before she could\r\nregain consciousness. On the question of whether she had been shot or\r\nhad shot herself he would not venture to express any decided opinion.\r\nCertainly the bullet had been discharged at very close quarters. There\r\nwas only the one pistol found in the room, two barrels of which had\r\nbeen emptied. Mr. Hilton Cubitt had been shot through the heart. It was\r\nequally conceivable that he had shot her and then himself, or that\r\nshe had been the criminal, for the revolver lay upon the floor midway\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\n\"Has he been moved?\" asked Holmes.\r\n\r\n\"We have moved nothing except the lady. We could not leave her lying\r\nwounded upon the floor.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long have you been here, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since four o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyone else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the constable here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have touched nothing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have acted with great discretion. Who sent for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The housemaid, Saunders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was it she who gave the alarm?\"\r\n\r\n\"She and Mrs. King, the cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they now?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the kitchen, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I think we had better hear their story at once.\"\r\n\r\nThe old hall, oak-panelled and high-windowed, had been turned into a\r\ncourt of investigation. Holmes sat in a great, old-fashioned chair, his\r\ninexorable eyes gleaming out of his haggard face. I could read in them\r\na set purpose to devote his life to this quest until the client whom he\r\nhad failed to save should at last be avenged. The trim Inspector Martin,\r\nthe old, grey-headed country doctor, myself, and a stolid village\r\npoliceman made up the rest of that strange company.\r\n\r\nThe two women told their story clearly enough. They had been aroused\r\nfrom their sleep by the sound of an explosion, which had been followed\r\na minute later by a second one. They slept in adjoining rooms, and Mrs.\r\nKing had rushed in to Saunders. Together they had descended the stairs.\r\nThe door of the study was open and a candle was burning upon the table.\r\nTheir master lay upon his face in the centre of the room. He was quite\r\ndead. Near the window his wife was crouching, her head leaning against\r\nthe wall. She was horribly wounded, and the side of her face was red\r\nwith blood. She breathed heavily, but was incapable of saying anything.\r\nThe passage, as well as the room, was full of smoke and the smell of\r\npowder. The window was certainly shut and fastened upon the inside. Both\r\nwomen were positive upon the point. They had at once sent for the\r\ndoctor and for the constable. Then, with the aid of the groom and the\r\nstable-boy, they had conveyed their injured mistress to her room. Both\r\nshe and her husband had occupied the bed. She was clad in her dress--he\r\nin his dressing-gown, over his night clothes. Nothing had been moved in\r\nthe study. So far as they knew there had never been any quarrel between\r\nhusband and wife. They had always looked upon them as a very united\r\ncouple.\r\n\r\nThese were the main points of the servants' evidence. In answer to\r\nInspector Martin they were clear that every door was fastened upon the\r\ninside, and that no one could have escaped from the house. In answer\r\nto Holmes they both remembered that they were conscious of the smell\r\nof powder from the moment that they ran out of their rooms upon the\r\ntop floor. \"I commend that fact very carefully to your attention,\" said\r\nHolmes to his professional colleague. \"And now I think that we are in a\r\nposition to undertake a thorough examination of the room.\"\r\n\r\nThe study proved to be a small chamber, lined on three sides with books,\r\nand with a writing-table facing an ordinary window, which looked out\r\nupon the garden. Our first attention was given to the body of the\r\nunfortunate squire, whose huge frame lay stretched across the room. His\r\ndisordered dress showed that he had been hastily aroused from sleep.\r\nThe bullet had been fired at him from the front, and had remained in\r\nhis body after penetrating the heart. His death had certainly been\r\ninstantaneous and painless. There was no powder-marking either upon his\r\ndressing-gown or on his hands. According to the country surgeon the lady\r\nhad stains upon her face, but none upon her hand.\r\n\r\n\"The absence of the latter means nothing, though its presence may\r\nmean everything,\" said Holmes. \"Unless the powder from a badly-fitting\r\ncartridge happens to spurt backwards, one may fire many shots without\r\nleaving a sign. I would suggest that Mr. Cubitt's body may now be\r\nremoved. I suppose, doctor, you have not recovered the bullet which\r\nwounded the lady?\"\r\n\r\n\"A serious operation will be necessary before that can be done. But\r\nthere are still four cartridges in the revolver. Two have been fired and\r\ntwo wounds inflicted, so that each bullet can be accounted for.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it would seem,\" said Holmes. \"Perhaps you can account also for the\r\nbullet which has so obviously struck the edge of the window?\"\r\n\r\nHe had turned suddenly, and his long, thin finger was pointing to a hole\r\nwhich had been drilled right through the lower window-sash about an inch\r\nabove the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" cried the inspector. \"How ever did you see that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I looked for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\" said the country doctor. \"You are certainly right, sir.\r\nThen a third shot has been fired, and therefore a third person must have\r\nbeen present. But who could that have been and how could he have got\r\naway?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the problem which we are now about to solve,\" said Sherlock\r\nHolmes. \"You remember, Inspector Martin, when the servants said that on\r\nleaving their room they were at once conscious of a smell of powder I\r\nremarked that the point was an extremely important one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; but I confess I did not quite follow you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It suggested that at the time of the firing the window as well as the\r\ndoor of the room had been open. Otherwise the fumes of powder could not\r\nhave been blown so rapidly through the house. A draught in the room was\r\nnecessary for that. Both door and window were only open for a very short\r\ntime, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you prove that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the candle has not guttered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Capital!\" cried the inspector. \"Capital!\"\r\n\r\n\"Feeling sure that the window had been open at the time of the tragedy\r\nI conceived that there might have been a third person in the affair, who\r\nstood outside this opening and fired through it. Any shot directed at\r\nthis person might hit the sash. I looked, and there, sure enough, was\r\nthe bullet mark!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how came the window to be shut and fastened?\"\r\n\r\n\"The woman's first instinct would be to shut and fasten the window. But,\r\nhalloa! what is this?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a lady's hand-bag which stood upon the study table--a trim little\r\nhand-bag of crocodile-skin and silver. Holmes opened it and turned\r\nthe contents out. There were twenty fifty-pound notes of the Bank of\r\nEngland, held together by an india-rubber band--nothing else.\r\n\r\n\"This must be preserved, for it will figure in the trial,\" said Holmes,\r\nas he handed the bag with its contents to the inspector. \"It is now\r\nnecessary that we should try to throw some light upon this third bullet,\r\nwhich has clearly, from the splintering of the wood, been fired from\r\ninside the room. I should like to see Mrs. King, the cook, again. You\r\nsaid, Mrs. King, that you were awakened by a LOUD explosion. When you\r\nsaid that, did you mean that it seemed to you to be louder than the\r\nsecond one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it wakened me from my sleep, and so it is hard to judge. But\r\nit did seem very loud.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't think that it might have been two shots fired almost at the\r\nsame instant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure I couldn't say, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that it was undoubtedly so. I rather think, Inspector Martin,\r\nthat we have now exhausted all that this room can teach us. If you will\r\nkindly step round with me, we shall see what fresh evidence the garden\r\nhas to offer.\"\r\n\r\nA flower-bed extended up to the study window, and we all broke into an\r\nexclamation as we approached it. The flowers were trampled down, and the\r\nsoft soil was imprinted all over with footmarks. Large, masculine feet\r\nthey were, with peculiarly long, sharp toes. Holmes hunted about among\r\nthe grass and leaves like a retriever after a wounded bird. Then, with\r\na cry of satisfaction, he bent forward and picked up a little brazen\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said he; \"the revolver had an ejector, and here is the\r\nthird cartridge. I really think, Inspector Martin, that our case is\r\nalmost complete.\"\r\n\r\nThe country inspector's face had shown his intense amazement at the\r\nrapid and masterful progress of Holmes's investigation. At first he\r\nhad shown some disposition to assert his own position; but now he was\r\novercome with admiration and ready to follow without question wherever\r\nHolmes led.\r\n\r\n\"Whom do you suspect?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go into that later. There are several points in this problem which\r\nI have not been able to explain to you yet. Now that I have got so far\r\nI had best proceed on my own lines, and then clear the whole matter up\r\nonce and for all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as you wish, Mr. Holmes, so long as we get our man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no desire to make mysteries, but it is impossible at the moment\r\nof action to enter into long and complex explanations. I have the\r\nthreads of this affair all in my hand. Even if this lady should never\r\nrecover consciousness we can still reconstruct the events of last night\r\nand ensure that justice be done. First of all I wish to know whether\r\nthere is any inn in this neighbourhood known as 'Elrige's'?\"\r\n\r\nThe servants were cross-questioned, but none of them had heard of such a\r\nplace. The stable-boy threw a light upon the matter by remembering that\r\na farmer of that name lived some miles off in the direction of East\r\nRuston.\r\n\r\n\"Is it a lonely farm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very lonely, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps they have not heard yet of all that happened here during the\r\nnight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe not, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes thought for a little and then a curious smile played over his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Saddle a horse, my lad,\" said he. \"I shall wish you to take a note to\r\nElrige's Farm.\"\r\n\r\nHe took from his pocket the various slips of the dancing men. With these\r\nin front of him he worked for some time at the study-table. Finally he\r\nhanded a note to the boy, with directions to put it into the hands\r\nof the person to whom it was addressed, and especially to answer no\r\nquestions of any sort which might be put to him. I saw the outside of\r\nthe note, addressed in straggling, irregular characters, very unlike\r\nHolmes's usual precise hand. It was consigned to Mr. Abe Slaney,\r\nElrige's Farm, East Ruston, Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\"I think, inspector,\" Holmes remarked, \"that you would do well to\r\ntelegraph for an escort, as, if my calculations prove to be correct, you\r\nmay have a particularly dangerous prisoner to convey to the county gaol.\r\nThe boy who takes this note could no doubt forward your telegram. If\r\nthere is an afternoon train to town, Watson, I think we should do well\r\nto take it, as I have a chemical analysis of some interest to finish,\r\nand this investigation draws rapidly to a close.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the youth had been dispatched with the note, Sherlock Holmes gave\r\nhis instructions to the servants. If any visitor were to call asking for\r\nMrs. Hilton Cubitt no information should be given as to her condition,\r\nbut he was to be shown at once into the drawing-room. He impressed these\r\npoints upon them with the utmost earnestness. Finally he led the way\r\ninto the drawing-room with the remark that the business was now out of\r\nour hands, and that we must while away the time as best we might until\r\nwe could see what was in store for us. The doctor had departed to his\r\npatients, and only the inspector and myself remained.\r\n\r\n\"I think that I can help you to pass an hour in an interesting and\r\nprofitable manner,\" said Holmes, drawing his chair up to the table\r\nand spreading out in front of him the various papers upon which were\r\nrecorded the antics of the dancing men. \"As to you, friend Watson, I owe\r\nyou every atonement for having allowed your natural curiosity to remain\r\nso long unsatisfied. To you, inspector, the whole incident may appeal\r\nas a remarkable professional study. I must tell you first of all the\r\ninteresting circumstances connected with the previous consultations\r\nwhich Mr. Hilton Cubitt has had with me in Baker Street.\" He then\r\nshortly recapitulated the facts which have already been recorded. \"I\r\nhave here in front of me these singular productions, at which one\r\nmight smile had they not proved themselves to be the fore-runners of\r\nso terrible a tragedy. I am fairly familiar with all forms of secret\r\nwritings, and am myself the author of a trifling monograph upon the\r\nsubject, in which I analyze one hundred and sixty separate ciphers;\r\nbut I confess that this is entirely new to me. The object of those who\r\ninvented the system has apparently been to conceal that these characters\r\nconvey a message, and to give the idea that they are the mere random\r\nsketches of children.\r\n\r\n\"Having once recognised, however, that the symbols stood for letters,\r\nand having applied the rules which guide us in all forms of secret\r\nwritings, the solution was easy enough. The first message submitted to\r\nme was so short that it was impossible for me to do more than to say\r\nwith some confidence that the symbol XXX stood for E. As you are aware,\r\nE is the most common letter in the English alphabet, and it predominates\r\nto so marked an extent that even in a short sentence one would expect\r\nto find it most often. Out of fifteen symbols in the first message four\r\nwere the same, so it was reasonable to set this down as E. It is true\r\nthat in some cases the figure was bearing a flag and in some cases not,\r\nbut it was probable from the way in which the flags were distributed\r\nthat they were used to break the sentence up into words. I accepted this\r\nas a hypothesis, and noted that E was represented by XXX.\r\n\r\n\"But now came the real difficulty of the inquiry. The order of\r\nthe English letters after E is by no means well marked, and any\r\npreponderance which may be shown in an average of a printed sheet may be\r\nreversed in a single short sentence. Speaking roughly, T, A, O, I, N, S,\r\nH, R, D, and L are the numerical order in which letters occur; but T,\r\nA, O, and I are very nearly abreast of each other, and it would be an\r\nendless task to try each combination until a meaning was arrived at. I,\r\ntherefore, waited for fresh material. In my second interview with Mr.\r\nHilton Cubitt he was able to give me two other short sentences and one\r\nmessage, which appeared--since there was no flag--to be a single word.\r\nHere are the symbols. Now, in the single word I have already got the\r\ntwo E's coming second and fourth in a word of five letters. It might\r\nbe 'sever,' or 'lever,' or 'never.' There can be no question that\r\nthe latter as a reply to an appeal is far the most probable, and\r\nthe circumstances pointed to its being a reply written by the lady.\r\nAccepting it as correct, we are now able to say that the symbols XXX\r\nstand respectively for N, V, and R.\r\n\r\n\"Even now I was in considerable difficulty, but a happy thought put me\r\nin possession of several other letters. It occurred to me that if these\r\nappeals came, as I expected, from someone who had been intimate with the\r\nlady in her early life, a combination which contained two E's with\r\nthree letters between might very well stand for the name 'ELSIE.' On\r\nexamination I found that such a combination formed the termination of\r\nthe message which was three times repeated. It was certainly some appeal\r\nto 'Elsie.' In this way I had got my L, S, and I. But what appeal could\r\nit be? There were only four letters in the word which preceded 'Elsie,'\r\nand it ended in E. Surely the word must be 'COME.' I tried all other\r\nfour letters ending in E, but could find none to fit the case. So now I\r\nwas in possession of C, O, and M, and I was in a position to attack the\r\nfirst message once more, dividing it into words and putting dots for\r\neach symbol which was still unknown. So treated it worked out in this\r\nfashion:--\r\n\r\n       .M .ERE ..E  SL.NE.\r\n\r\n\"Now the first letter CAN only be A, which is a most useful discovery,\r\nsince it occurs no fewer than three times in this short sentence, and\r\nthe H is also apparent in the second word. Now it becomes:--\r\n\r\n        AM  HERE  A.E  SLANE.\r\n\r\nOr, filling in the obvious vacancies in the name:--\r\n\r\n        AM  HERE  ABE  SLANEY.\r\n\r\nI had so many letters now that I could proceed with considerable\r\nconfidence to the second message, which worked out in this fashion:--\r\n\r\n        A.  ELRI.ES.\r\n\r\nHere I could only make sense by putting T and G for the missing letters,\r\nand supposing that the name was that of some house or inn at which the\r\nwriter was staying.\"\r\n\r\nInspector Martin and I had listened with the utmost interest to the full\r\nand clear account of how my friend had produced results which had led to\r\nso complete a command over our difficulties.\r\n\r\n\"What did you do then, sir?\" asked the inspector.\r\n\r\n\"I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an American,\r\nsince Abe is an American contraction, and since a letter from America\r\nhad been the starting-point of all the trouble. I had also every cause\r\nto think that there was some criminal secret in the matter. The lady's\r\nallusions to her past and her refusal to take her husband into her\r\nconfidence both pointed in that direction. I therefore cabled to my\r\nfriend, Wilson Hargreave, of the New York Police Bureau, who has more\r\nthan once made use of my knowledge of London crime. I asked him whether\r\nthe name of Abe Slaney was known to him. Here is his reply: 'The most\r\ndangerous crook in Chicago.' On the very evening upon which I had his\r\nanswer Hilton Cubitt sent me the last message from Slaney. Working with\r\nknown letters it took this form:--\r\n\r\n         ELSIE .RE.ARE  TO  MEET  THY  GO.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a P and a D completed a message which showed me that the\r\nrascal was proceeding from persuasion to threats, and my knowledge of\r\nthe crooks of Chicago prepared me to find that he might very rapidly\r\nput his words into action. I at once came to Norfolk with my friend and\r\ncolleague, Dr. Watson, but, unhappily, only in time to find that the\r\nworst had already occurred.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a privilege to be associated with you in the handling of a case,\"\r\nsaid the inspector, warmly. \"You will excuse me, however, if I speak\r\nfrankly to you. You are only answerable to yourself, but I have to\r\nanswer to my superiors. If this Abe Slaney, living at Elrige's, is\r\nindeed the murderer, and if he has made his escape while I am seated\r\nhere, I should certainly get into serious trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not be uneasy. He will not try to escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"To fly would be a confession of guilt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us go to arrest him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I expect him here every instant.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should he come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have written and asked him.\"\r\n\r\n\"But this is incredible, Mr. Holmes! Why should he come because you\r\nhave asked him? Would not such a request rather rouse his suspicions and\r\ncause him to fly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have known how to frame the letter,\" said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\"In fact, if I am not very much mistaken, here is the gentleman himself\r\ncoming up the drive.\"\r\n\r\nA man was striding up the path which led to the door. He was a tall,\r\nhandsome, swarthy fellow, clad in a suit of grey flannel, with a Panama\r\nhat, a bristling black beard, and a great, aggressive hooked nose, and\r\nflourishing a cane as he walked. He swaggered up the path as if the\r\nplace belonged to him, and we heard his loud, confident peal at the\r\nbell.\r\n\r\n\"I think, gentlemen,\" said Holmes, quietly, \"that we had best take up\r\nour position behind the door. Every precaution is necessary when dealing\r\nwith such a fellow. You will need your handcuffs, inspector. You can\r\nleave the talking to me.\"\r\n\r\nWe waited in silence for a minute--one of those minutes which one can\r\nnever forget. Then the door opened and the man stepped in. In an instant\r\nHolmes clapped a pistol to his head and Martin slipped the handcuffs\r\nover his wrists. It was all done so swiftly and deftly that the fellow\r\nwas helpless before he knew that he was attacked. He glared from one to\r\nthe other of us with a pair of blazing black eyes. Then he burst into a\r\nbitter laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Well, gentlemen, you have the drop on me this time. I seem to have\r\nknocked up against something hard. But I came here in answer to a letter\r\nfrom Mrs. Hilton Cubitt. Don't tell me that she is in this? Don't tell\r\nme that she helped to set a trap for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Hilton Cubitt was seriously injured and is at death's door.\"\r\n\r\nThe man gave a hoarse cry of grief which rang through the house.\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy!\" he cried, fiercely. \"It was he that was hurt, not she.\r\nWho would have hurt little Elsie? I may have threatened her, God forgive\r\nme, but I would not have touched a hair of her pretty head. Take it\r\nback--you! Say that she is not hurt!\"\r\n\r\n\"She was found badly wounded by the side of her dead husband.\"\r\n\r\nHe sank with a deep groan on to the settee and buried his face in his\r\nmanacled hands. For five minutes he was silent. Then he raised his face\r\nonce more, and spoke with the cold composure of despair.\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to hide from you, gentlemen,\" said he. \"If I shot the\r\nman he had his shot at me, and there's no murder in that. But if you\r\nthink I could have hurt that woman, then you don't know either me or\r\nher. I tell you there was never a man in this world loved a woman more\r\nthan I loved her. I had a right to her. She was pledged to me years ago.\r\nWho was this Englishman that he should come between us? I tell you that\r\nI had the first right to her, and that I was only claiming my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"She broke away from your influence when she found the man that you\r\nare,\" said Holmes, sternly. \"She fled from America to avoid you, and she\r\nmarried an honourable gentleman in England. You dogged her and followed\r\nher and made her life a misery to her in order to induce her to abandon\r\nthe husband whom she loved and respected in order to fly with you, whom\r\nshe feared and hated. You have ended by bringing about the death of a\r\nnoble man and driving his wife to suicide. That is your record in this\r\nbusiness, Mr. Abe Slaney, and you will answer for it to the law.\"\r\n\r\n\"If Elsie dies I care nothing what becomes of me,\" said the American.\r\nHe opened one of his hands and looked at a note crumpled up in his palm.\r\n\"See here, mister,\" he cried, with a gleam of suspicion in his eyes,\r\n\"you're not trying to scare me over this, are you? If the lady is\r\nhurt as bad as you say, who was it that wrote this note?\" He tossed it\r\nforwards on to the table.\r\n\r\n\"I wrote it to bring you here.\"\r\n\r\n\"You wrote it? There was no one on earth outside the Joint who knew the\r\nsecret of the dancing men. How came you to write it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What one man can invent another can discover,\" said Holmes. There is\r\na cab coming to convey you to Norwich, Mr. Slaney. But, meanwhile, you\r\nhave time to make some small reparation for the injury you have wrought.\r\nAre you aware that Mrs. Hilton Cubitt has herself lain under grave\r\nsuspicion of the murder of her husband, and that it was only my presence\r\nhere and the knowledge which I happened to possess which has saved her\r\nfrom the accusation? The least that you owe her is to make it clear\r\nto the whole world that she was in no way, directly or indirectly,\r\nresponsible for his tragic end.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ask nothing better,\" said the American. \"I guess the very best case I\r\ncan make for myself is the absolute naked truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is my duty to warn you that it will be used against you,\" cried the\r\ninspector, with the magnificent fair-play of the British criminal law.\r\n\r\nSlaney shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"I'll chance that,\" said he. \"First of all, I want you gentlemen to\r\nunderstand that I have known this lady since she was a child. There were\r\nseven of us in a gang in Chicago, and Elsie's father was the boss of the\r\nJoint. He was a clever man, was old Patrick. It was he who invented that\r\nwriting, which would pass as a child's scrawl unless you just happened\r\nto have the key to it. Well, Elsie learned some of our ways; but she\r\ncouldn't stand the business, and she had a bit of honest money of her\r\nown, so she gave us all the slip and got away to London. She had been\r\nengaged to me, and she would have married me, I believe, if I had taken\r\nover another profession; but she would have nothing to do with anything\r\non the cross. It was only after her marriage to this Englishman that I\r\nwas able to find out where she was. I wrote to her, but got no answer.\r\nAfter that I came over, and, as letters were no use, I put my messages\r\nwhere she could read them.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have been here a month now. I lived in that farm, where I had\r\na room down below, and could get in and out every night, and no one the\r\nwiser. I tried all I could to coax Elsie away. I knew that she read the\r\nmessages, for once she wrote an answer under one of them. Then my temper\r\ngot the better of me, and I began to threaten her. She sent me a letter\r\nthen, imploring me to go away and saying that it would break her heart\r\nif any scandal should come upon her husband. She said that she would\r\ncome down when her husband was asleep at three in the morning, and speak\r\nwith me through the end window, if I would go away afterwards and leave\r\nher in peace. She came down and brought money with her, trying to bribe\r\nme to go. This made me mad, and I caught her arm and tried to pull\r\nher through the window. At that moment in rushed the husband with his\r\nrevolver in his hand. Elsie had sunk down upon the floor, and we were\r\nface to face. I was heeled also, and I held up my gun to scare him off\r\nand let me get away. He fired and missed me. I pulled off almost at the\r\nsame instant, and down he dropped. I made away across the garden, and as\r\nI went I heard the window shut behind me. That's God's truth, gentlemen,\r\nevery word of it, and I heard no more about it until that lad came\r\nriding up with a note which made me walk in here, like a jay, and give\r\nmyself into your hands.\"\r\n\r\nA cab had driven up whilst the American had been talking. Two uniformed\r\npolicemen sat inside. Inspector Martin rose and touched his prisoner on\r\nthe shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"It is time for us to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I see her first?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, she is not conscious. Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I only hope that if ever\r\nagain I have an important case I shall have the good fortune to have you\r\nby my side.\"\r\n\r\nWe stood at the window and watched the cab drive away. As I turned back\r\nmy eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed upon the\r\ntable. It was the note with which Holmes had decoyed him.\r\n\r\n\"See if you can read it, Watson,\" said he, with a smile.\r\n\r\nIt contained no word, but this little line of dancing men:--\r\n\r\nGRAPHIC\r\n\r\n\"If you use the code which I have explained,\" said Holmes, \"you will\r\nfind that it simply means 'Come here at once.' I was convinced that\r\nit was an invitation which he would not refuse, since he could never\r\nimagine that it could come from anyone but the lady. And so, my dear\r\nWatson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they have\r\nso often been the agents of evil, and I think that I have fulfilled my\r\npromise of giving you something unusual for your note-book. Three-forty\r\nis our train, and I fancy we should be back in Baker Street for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly one word of epilogue. The American, Abe Slaney, was condemned to\r\ndeath at the winter assizes at Norwich; but his penalty was changed to\r\npenal servitude in consideration of mitigating circumstances, and the\r\ncertainty that Hilton Cubitt had fired the first shot. Of Mrs. Hilton\r\nCubitt I only know that I have heard she recovered entirely, and that\r\nshe still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the care of the\r\npoor and to the administration of her husband's estate.", "The Adventure of the Second Stain": "I HAD intended \"The Adventure of the Abbey Grange\" to be the last of\r\nthose exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever\r\ncommunicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any\r\nlack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to which\r\nI have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest on the\r\npart of my readers in the singular personality and unique methods of\r\nthis remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance which Mr.\r\nHolmes has shown to the continued publication of his experiences.\r\nSo long as he was in actual professional practice the records of\r\nhis successes were of some practical value to him; but since he\r\nhas definitely retired from London and betaken himself to study and\r\nbee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become hateful to him,\r\nand he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in this matter should\r\nbe strictly observed. It was only upon my representing to him that I\r\nhad given a promise that \"The Adventure of the Second Stain\" should be\r\npublished when the times were ripe, and pointing out to him that it is\r\nonly appropriate that this long series of episodes should culminate in\r\nthe most important international case which he has ever been called\r\nupon to handle, that I at last succeeded in obtaining his consent that a\r\ncarefully-guarded account of the incident should at last be laid before\r\nthe public. If in telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in\r\ncertain details the public will readily understand that there is an\r\nexcellent reason for my reticence.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be nameless,\r\nthat upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two visitors of\r\nEuropean fame within the walls of our humble room in Baker Street. The\r\none, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant, was none other than\r\nthe illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of Britain. The other,\r\ndark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of middle age, and endowed with\r\nevery beauty of body and of mind, was the Right Honourable Trelawney\r\nHope, Secretary for European Affairs, and the most rising statesman in\r\nthe country. They sat side by side upon our paper-littered settee,\r\nand it was easy to see from their worn and anxious faces that it was\r\nbusiness of the most pressing importance which had brought them. The\r\nPremier's thin, blue-veined hands were clasped tightly over the ivory\r\nhead of his umbrella, and his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from\r\nHolmes to me. The European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache\r\nand fidgeted with the seals of his watch-chain.\r\n\r\n\"When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock this\r\nmorning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his suggestion\r\nthat we have both come to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you informed the police?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner for\r\nwhich he was famous. \"We have not done so, nor is it possible that we\r\nshould do so. To inform the police must, in the long run, mean to inform\r\nthe public. This is what we particularly desire to avoid.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the document in question is of such immense importance that\r\nits publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead to\r\nEuropean complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to say\r\nthat peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery can be\r\nattended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be recovered\r\nat all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it is that its\r\ncontents should be generally known.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if\r\nyou would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document\r\ndisappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it\r\nwas a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It\r\nwas of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I have\r\ntaken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace, and kept\r\nit in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last night. Of\r\nthat I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was dressing for\r\ndinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was gone. The\r\ndespatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my dressing-table all\r\nnight. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We are both prepared to\r\nswear that no one could have entered the room during the night. And yet\r\nI repeat that the paper is gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time did you dine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Half-past seven.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long was it before you went to bed?\"\r\n\r\n\"My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was half-past\r\neleven before we went to our room.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in the\r\nmorning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the day.\r\nThey are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time.\r\nBesides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was\r\nanything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my\r\ndespatch-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did know of the existence of that letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely your wife knew?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Premier nodded approvingly.\r\n\r\n\"I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty,\" said\r\nhe. \"I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance it\r\nwould rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties.\"\r\n\r\nThe European Secretary bowed.\r\n\r\n\"You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never\r\nbreathed one word to my wife upon this matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could she have guessed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have\r\nguessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you lost any documents before?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the pledge\r\nof secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased by the\r\nsolemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good heavens,\r\nto think that within a few hours I should myself have lost it!\" His\r\nhandsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his hands\r\ntore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the natural man,\r\nimpulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the aristocratic mask was\r\nreplaced, and the gentle voice had returned. \"Besides the members of\r\nthe Cabinet there are two, or possibly three, departmental officials who\r\nknow of the letter. No one else in England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But abroad?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it. I\r\nam well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official channels\r\nhave not been employed.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes considered for some little time.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is, and\r\nwhy its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?\"\r\n\r\nThe two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy\r\neyebrows gathered in a frown.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour. There\r\nis a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is addressed in\r\nlarge, bold handwriting to--\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, sir,\" said Holmes, \"that, interesting and indeed essential as\r\nthese details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of things. What\r\nWAS the letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I\r\ncannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of the\r\npowers which you are said to possess you can find such an envelope as\r\nI describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved well of your\r\ncountry, and earned any reward which it lies in our power to bestow.\"\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes rose with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"You are two of the most busy men in the country,\" said he, \"and in\r\nmy own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret\r\nexceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any continuation\r\nof this interview would be a waste of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his\r\ndeep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. \"I am not accustomed,\r\nsir----\" he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his seat. For a\r\nminute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old statesman shrugged\r\nhis shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and\r\nit is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our\r\nentire confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you, sir,\" said the younger statesman.\r\n\r\n\"Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of\r\nyour colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for\r\nI could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that this\r\naffair should come out.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may safely trust us.\"\r\n\r\n\"The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been\r\nruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It\r\nhas been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.\r\nInquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter.\r\nAt the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and certain\r\nphrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its publication\r\nwould undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of feeling in this\r\ncountry. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I do not hesitate to\r\nsay that within a week of the publication of that letter this country\r\nwould be involved in a great war.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the Premier.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may well\r\nmean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a hundred\r\nthousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable fashion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you informed the sender?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already understands\r\nthat he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner. It would be a\r\ngreater blow to him and to his country than to us if this letter were to\r\ncome out.\"\r\n\r\n\"If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?\r\nWhy should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international\r\npolitics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no\r\ndifficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed\r\ncamp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military\r\npower. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into\r\nwar with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other\r\nconfederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this potentate\r\nto secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach between his\r\ncountry and ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of an\r\nenemy?\"\r\n\r\n\"To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding on\r\nits way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take it.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud. The\r\nPremier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There is\r\nno precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are in full\r\npossession of the facts. What course do you recommend?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes shook his head mournfully.\r\n\r\n\"You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be\r\nwar?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it is very probable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, sir, prepare for war.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after\r\neleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife\r\nwere both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out.\r\nIt was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and\r\neleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it\r\nevidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as early\r\nas possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were taken at\r\nthat hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to retain it. It\r\nhas been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What chance have we now\r\nto overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our reach.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister rose from the settee.\r\n\r\n\"What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the matter\r\nis indeed out of our hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by the\r\nmaid or by the valet----\"\r\n\r\n\"They are both old and tried servants.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that\r\nthere is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could go\r\nup unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has taken it.\r\nTo whom would the thief take it? To one of several international spies\r\nand secret agents, whose names are tolerably familiar to me. There are\r\nthree who may be said to be the heads of their profession. I will begin\r\nmy research by going round and finding if each of them is at his post.\r\nIf one is missing--especially if he has disappeared since last night--we\r\nwill have some indication as to where the document has gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should he be missing?\" asked the European Secretary. \"He would take\r\nthe letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations with\r\nthe Embassies are often strained.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a prize\r\nto head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course of action\r\nis an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all our other\r\nduties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be any fresh\r\ndevelopments during the day we shall communicate with you, and you will\r\nno doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries.\"\r\n\r\nThe two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.\r\n\r\nWhen our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in\r\nsilence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had opened\r\nthe morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime which had\r\noccurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an exclamation,\r\nsprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"there is no better way of approaching it. The situation\r\nis desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be sure which of\r\nthem has taken it, it is just possible that it has not yet passed out of\r\nhis hands. After all, it is a question of money with these fellows, and\r\nI have the British Treasury behind me. If it's on the market I'll buy\r\nit--if it means another penny on the income-tax. It is conceivable\r\nthat the fellow might hold it back to see what bids come from this\r\nside before he tries his luck on the other. There are only those three\r\ncapable of playing so bold a game; there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and\r\nEduardo Lucas. I will see each of them.\"\r\n\r\nI glanced at my morning paper.\r\n\r\n\"Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will not see him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was murdered in his house last night.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures\r\nthat it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely I\r\nhad astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the\r\npaper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged in\r\nreading when he rose from his chair:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"MURDER IN WESTMINSTER.\r\n\r\n\"A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16,\r\nGodolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of\r\neighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey,\r\nalmost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament.\r\nThis small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by Mr.\r\nEduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of his\r\ncharming personality and because he has the well-deserved reputation\r\nof being one of the best amateur tenors in the country. Mr. Lucas is an\r\nunmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his establishment consists\r\nof Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and of Mitton, his valet. The\r\nformer retires early and sleeps at the top of the house. The valet was\r\nout for the evening, visiting a friend at Hammersmith. From ten o'clock\r\nonwards Mr. Lucas had the house to himself. What occurred during that\r\ntime has not yet transpired, but at a quarter to twelve Police-constable\r\nBarrett, passing along Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No.\r\n16 was ajar. He knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light\r\nin the front room he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but\r\nwithout reply. He then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in\r\na state of wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and\r\none chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still\r\ngrasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He\r\nhad been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife\r\nwith which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,\r\nplucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the\r\nwalls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime, for\r\nthere had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the room.\r\nMr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his violent and\r\nmysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense sympathy in a\r\nwide-spread circle of friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of this?\" asked Holmes, after a long\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\"It is an amazing coincidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as\r\npossible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during the\r\nvery hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The odds are\r\nenormous against its being coincidence. No figures could express them.\r\nNo, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--MUST be connected. It\r\nis for us to find the connection.\"\r\n\r\n\"But now the official police must know all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They know--and\r\nshall know--nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only WE know of both events,\r\nand can trace the relation between them. There is one obvious point\r\nwhich would, in any case, have turned my suspicions against Lucas.\r\nGodolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes' walk from\r\nWhitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have named live in\r\nthe extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore, for Lucas than for the\r\nothers to establish a connection or receive a message from the\r\nEuropean Secretary's household--a small thing, and yet where events are\r\ncompressed into a few hours it may prove essential. Halloa! what have we\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes\r\nglanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step up,\"\r\nsaid he.\r\n\r\nA moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that\r\nmorning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely woman\r\nin London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest daughter of\r\nthe Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no contemplation\r\nof colourless photographs, had prepared me for the subtle, delicate\r\ncharm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite head. And yet as\r\nwe saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty which would be the\r\nfirst thing to impress the observer. The cheek was lovely, but it was\r\npaled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it was the brightness\r\nof fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn in an effort after\r\nself-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang first to the eye as\r\nour fair visitor stood framed for an instant in the open door.\r\n\r\n\"Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, madam, he has been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here.\" Holmes\r\nbowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you\r\nwill sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot make\r\nany unconditional promise.\"\r\n\r\nShe swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the\r\nwindow. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely\r\nwomanly.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes,\" she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and unclasped\r\nas she spoke--\"I will speak frankly to you in the hope that it may\r\ninduce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete confidence\r\nbetween my husband and me on all matters save one. That one is politics.\r\nOn this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing. Now, I am aware that\r\nthere was a most deplorable occurrence in our house last night. I know\r\nthat a paper has disappeared. But because the matter is political my\r\nhusband refuses to take me into his complete confidence. Now it is\r\nessential--essential, I say--that I should thoroughly understand it. You\r\nare the only other person, save only these politicians, who knows the\r\ntrue facts. I beg you, then, Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has\r\nhappened and what it will lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no\r\nregard for your client's interests keep you silent, for I assure you\r\nthat his interests, if he would only see it, would be best served by\r\ntaking me into his complete confidence. What was this paper which was\r\nstolen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam, what you ask me is really impossible.\"\r\n\r\nShe groaned and sank her face in her hands.\r\n\r\n\"You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to keep\r\nyou in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the\r\ntrue facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to tell what he has\r\nwithheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom you must ask.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your\r\ntelling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service if\r\nyou would enlighten me on one point.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this\r\nincident?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very\r\nunfortunate effect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are resolved.\r\n\r\n\"One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband\r\ndropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that terrible\r\npublic consequences might arise from the loss of this document.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he said so, I certainly cannot deny it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what nature are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will take up no more of your time. I cannot blame you, Mr.\r\nHolmes, for having refused to speak more freely, and you on your side\r\nwill not, I am sure, think the worse of me because I desire, even\r\nagainst his will, to share my husband's anxieties. Once more I beg that\r\nyou will say nothing of my visit.\" She looked back at us from the door,\r\nand I had a last impression of that beautiful haunted face, the startled\r\neyes, and the drawn mouth. Then she was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Watson, the fair sex is your department,\" said Holmes, with a\r\nsmile, when the dwindling frou-frou of skirts had ended in the slam\r\nof the front door. \"What was the fair lady's game? What did she really\r\nwant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely her own statement is clear and her anxiety very natural.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hum! Think of her appearance, Watson--her manner, her suppressed\r\nexcitement, her restlessness, her tenacity in asking questions. Remember\r\nthat she comes of a caste who do not lightly show emotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was certainly much moved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember also the curious earnestness with which she assured us that it\r\nwas best for her husband that she should know all. What did she mean by\r\nthat? And you must have observed, Watson, how she manoeuvred to have the\r\nlight at her back. She did not wish us to read her expression.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; she chose the one chair in the room.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet the motives of women are so inscrutable. You remember the\r\nwoman at Margate whom I suspected for the same reason. No powder on her\r\nnose--that proved to be the correct solution. How can you build on such\r\na quicksand? Their most trivial action may mean volumes, or their most\r\nextraordinary conduct may depend upon a hairpin or a curling-tongs. Good\r\nmorning, Watson.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I will wile away the morning at Godolphin Street with our friends\r\nof the regular establishment. With Eduardo Lucas lies the solution of\r\nour problem, though I must admit that I have not an inkling as to what\r\nform it may take. It is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of\r\nthe facts. Do you stay on guard, my good Watson, and receive any fresh\r\nvisitors. I'll join you at lunch if I am able.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that day and the next and the next Holmes was in a mood which his\r\nfriends would call taciturn, and others morose. He ran out and ran in,\r\nsmoked incessantly, played snatches on his violin, sank into reveries,\r\ndevoured sandwiches at irregular hours, and hardly answered the casual\r\nquestions which I put to him. It was evident to me that things were not\r\ngoing well with him or his quest. He would say nothing of the case, and\r\nit was from the papers that I learned the particulars of the inquest,\r\nand the arrest with the subsequent release of John Mitton, the valet of\r\nthe deceased. The coroner's jury brought in the obvious \"Wilful Murder,\"\r\nbut the parties remained as unknown as ever. No motive was suggested.\r\nThe room was full of articles of value, but none had been taken. The\r\ndead man's papers had not been tampered with. They were carefully\r\nexamined, and showed that he was a keen student of international\r\npolitics, an indefatigable gossip, a remarkable linguist, and an\r\nuntiring letter-writer. He had been on intimate terms with the leading\r\npoliticians of several countries. But nothing sensational was discovered\r\namong the documents which filled his drawers. As to his relations with\r\nwomen, they appeared to have been promiscuous but superficial. He had\r\nmany acquaintances among them, but few friends, and no one whom he\r\nloved. His habits were regular, his conduct inoffensive. His death was\r\nan absolute mystery, and likely to remain so.\r\n\r\nAs to the arrest of John Mitton, the valet, it was a counsel of despair\r\nas an alternative to absolute inaction. But no case could be sustained\r\nagainst him. He had visited friends in Hammersmith that night. The ALIBI\r\nwas complete. It is true that he started home at an hour which should\r\nhave brought him to Westminster before the time when the crime was\r\ndiscovered, but his own explanation that he had walked part of the way\r\nseemed probable enough in view of the fineness of the night. He had\r\nactually arrived at twelve o'clock, and appeared to be overwhelmed\r\nby the unexpected tragedy. He had always been on good terms with his\r\nmaster. Several of the dead man's possessions--notably a small case of\r\nrazors--had been found in the valet's boxes, but he explained that they\r\nhad been presents from the deceased, and the housekeeper was able to\r\ncorroborate the story. Mitton had been in Lucas's employment for three\r\nyears. It was noticeable that Lucas did not take Mitton on the Continent\r\nwith him. Sometimes he visited Paris for three months on end, but Mitton\r\nwas left in charge of the Godolphin Street house. As to the housekeeper,\r\nshe had heard nothing on the night of the crime. If her master had a\r\nvisitor he had himself admitted him.\r\n\r\nSo for three mornings the mystery remained, so far as I could follow it\r\nin the papers. If Holmes knew more he kept his own counsel, but, as he\r\ntold me that Inspector Lestrade had taken him into his confidence in the\r\ncase, I knew that he was in close touch with every development. Upon\r\nthe fourth day there appeared a long telegram from Paris which seemed to\r\nsolve the whole question.\r\n\r\n\"A discovery has just been made by the Parisian police,\" said the DAILY\r\nTELEGRAPH, \"which raises the veil which hung round the tragic fate of\r\nMr. Eduardo Lucas, who met his death by violence last Monday night\r\nat Godolphin Street, Westminster. Our readers will remember that\r\nthe deceased gentleman was found stabbed in his room, and that some\r\nsuspicion attached to his valet, but that the case broke down on an\r\nALIBI. Yesterday a lady, who has been known as Mme. Henri Fournaye,\r\noccupying a small villa in the Rue Austerlitz, was reported to the\r\nauthorities by her servants as being insane. An examination showed that\r\nshe had indeed developed mania of a dangerous and permanent form.\r\nOn inquiry the police have discovered that Mme. Henri Fournaye only\r\nreturned from a journey to London on Tuesday last, and there is\r\nevidence to connect her with the crime at Westminster. A comparison of\r\nphotographs has proved conclusively that M. Henri Fournaye and Eduardo\r\nLucas were really one and the same person, and that the deceased had for\r\nsome reason lived a double life in London and Paris. Mme. Fournaye,\r\nwho is of Creole origin, is of an extremely excitable nature, and has\r\nsuffered in the past from attacks of jealousy which have amounted to\r\nfrenzy. It is conjectured that it was in one of these that she committed\r\nthe terrible crime which has caused such a sensation in London. Her\r\nmovements upon the Monday night have not yet been traced, but it is\r\nundoubted that a woman answering to her description attracted much\r\nattention at Charing Cross Station on Tuesday morning by the wildness\r\nof her appearance and the violence of her gestures. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that the crime was either committed when insane, or that\r\nits immediate effect was to drive the unhappy woman out of her mind. At\r\npresent she is unable to give any coherent account of the past, and the\r\ndoctors hold out no hopes of the re-establishment of her reason. There\r\nis evidence that a woman, who might have been Mme. Fournaye, was seen\r\nfor some hours on Monday night watching the house in Godolphin Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of that, Holmes?\" I had read the account aloud to\r\nhim, while he finished his breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Watson,\" said he, as he rose from the table and paced up and\r\ndown the room, \"you are most long-suffering, but if I have told you\r\nnothing in the last three days it is because there is nothing to tell.\r\nEven now this report from Paris does not help us much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is final as regards the man's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"The man's death is a mere incident--a trivial episode--in comparison\r\nwith our real task, which is to trace this document and save a European\r\ncatastrophe. Only one important thing has happened in the last three\r\ndays, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports almost hourly\r\nfrom the Government, and it is certain that nowhere in Europe is there\r\nany sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were loose--no, it CAN'T be\r\nloose--but if it isn't loose, where can it be? Who has it? Why is it\r\nheld back? That's the question that beats in my brain like a hammer. Was\r\nit, indeed, a coincidence that Lucas should meet his death on the night\r\nwhen the letter disappeared? Did the letter ever reach him? If so, why\r\nis it not among his papers? Did this mad wife of his carry it off with\r\nher? If so, is it in her house in Paris? How could I search for it\r\nwithout the French police having their suspicions aroused? It is a case,\r\nmy dear Watson, where the law is as dangerous to us as the criminals\r\nare. Every man's hand is against us, and yet the interests at stake are\r\ncolossal. Should I bring it to a successful conclusion it will certainly\r\nrepresent the crowning glory of my career. Ah, here is my latest from\r\nthe front!\" He glanced hurriedly at the note which had been handed in.\r\n\"Halloa! Lestrade seems to have observed something of interest. Put on\r\nyour hat, Watson, and we will stroll down together to Westminster.\"\r\n\r\nIt was my first visit to the scene of the crime--a high, dingy,\r\nnarrow-chested house, prim, formal, and solid, like the century which\r\ngave it birth. Lestrade's bulldog features gazed out at us from the\r\nfront window, and he greeted us warmly when a big constable had opened\r\nthe door and let us in. The room into which we were shown was that in\r\nwhich the crime had been committed, but no trace of it now remained,\r\nsave an ugly, irregular stain upon the carpet. This carpet was a small\r\nsquare drugget in the centre of the room, surrounded by a broad expanse\r\nof beautiful, old-fashioned wood-flooring in square blocks highly\r\npolished. Over the fireplace was a magnificent trophy of weapons, one of\r\nwhich had been used on that tragic night. In the window was a sumptuous\r\nwriting-desk, and every detail of the apartment, the pictures, the rugs,\r\nand the hangings, all pointed to a taste which was luxurious to the\r\nverge of effeminacy.\r\n\r\n\"Seen the Paris news?\" asked Lestrade.\r\n\r\nHolmes nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Our French friends seem to have touched the spot this time. No doubt\r\nit's just as they say. She knocked at the door--surprise visit, I\r\nguess, for he kept his life in water-tight compartments. He let her\r\nin--couldn't keep her in the street. She told him how she had traced\r\nhim, reproached him, one thing led to another, and then with that dagger\r\nso handy the end soon came. It wasn't all done in an instant, though,\r\nfor these chairs were all swept over yonder, and he had one in his hand\r\nas if he had tried to hold her off with it. We've got it all clear as if\r\nwe had seen it.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes raised his eyebrows.\r\n\r\n\"And yet you have sent for me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes, that's another matter--a mere trifle, but the sort of thing\r\nyou take an interest in--queer, you know, and what you might call\r\nfreakish. It has nothing to do with the main fact--can't have, on the\r\nface of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you know, after a crime of this sort we are very careful to keep\r\nthings in their position. Nothing has been moved. Officer in charge here\r\nday and night. This morning, as the man was buried and the investigation\r\nover--so far as this room is concerned--we thought we could tidy up\r\na bit. This carpet. You see, it is not fastened down; only just laid\r\nthere. We had occasion to raise it. We found----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes? You found----\"\r\n\r\nHolmes's face grew tense with anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm sure you would never guess in a hundred years what we did\r\nfind. You see that stain on the carpet? Well, a great deal must have\r\nsoaked through, must it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly it must.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the white\r\nwoodwork to correspond.\"\r\n\r\n\"No stain! But there must----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; so you would say. But the fact remains that there isn't.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the corner of the carpet in his hand and, turning it over, he\r\nshowed that it was indeed as he said.\r\n\r\n\"But the underside is as stained as the upper. It must have left a\r\nmark.\"\r\n\r\nLestrade chuckled with delight at having puzzled the famous expert.\r\n\r\n\"Now I'll show you the explanation. There IS a second stain, but it does\r\nnot correspond with the other. See for yourself.\" As he spoke he turned\r\nover another portion of the carpet, and there, sure enough, was a great\r\ncrimson spill upon the square white facing of the old-fashioned floor.\r\n\"What do you make of that, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it is simple enough. The two stains did correspond, but the carpet\r\nhas been turned round. As it was square and unfastened it was easily\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The official police don't need you, Mr. Holmes, to tell them that the\r\ncarpet must have been turned round. That's clear enough, for the stains\r\nlie above each other--if you lay it over this way. But what I want to\r\nknow is, who shifted the carpet, and why?\"\r\n\r\nI could see from Holmes's rigid face that he was vibrating with inward\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Lestrade,\" said he, \"has that constable in the passage been\r\nin charge of the place all the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he has.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take my advice. Examine him carefully. Don't do it before us.\r\nWe'll wait here. You take him into the back room. You'll be more likely\r\nto get a confession out of him alone. Ask him how he dared to admit\r\npeople and leave them alone in this room. Don't ask him if he has done\r\nit. Take it for granted. Tell him you KNOW someone has been here. Press\r\nhim. Tell him that a full confession is his only chance of forgiveness.\r\nDo exactly what I tell you!\"\r\n\r\n\"By George, if he knows I'll have it out of him!\" cried Lestrade. He\r\ndarted into the hall, and a few moments later his bullying voice sounded\r\nfrom the back room.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Watson, now!\" cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. All the\r\ndemoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst out\r\nin a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and in an\r\ninstant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the squares\r\nof wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails into the\r\nedge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small black cavity\r\nopened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into it, and drew it\r\nout with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment. It was empty.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Watson, quick! Get it back again!\" The wooden lid was replaced,\r\nand the drugget had only just been drawn straight when Lestrade's voice\r\nwas heard in the passage. He found Holmes leaning languidly against\r\nthe mantelpiece, resigned and patient, endeavouring to conceal his\r\nirrepressible yawns.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to keep you waiting, Mr. Holmes. I can see that you are bored to\r\ndeath with the whole affair. Well, he has confessed, all right. Come\r\nin here, MacPherson. Let these gentlemen hear of your most inexcusable\r\nconduct.\"\r\n\r\nThe big constable, very hot and penitent, sidled into the room.\r\n\r\n\"I meant no harm, sir, I'm sure. The young woman came to the door last\r\nevening--mistook the house, she did. And then we got talking. It's\r\nlonesome, when you're on duty here all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what happened then?\"\r\n\r\n\"She wanted to see where the crime was done--had read about it in the\r\npapers, she said. She was a very respectable, well-spoken young woman,\r\nsir, and I saw no harm in letting her have a peep. When she saw that\r\nmark on the carpet, down she dropped on the floor, and lay as if she\r\nwere dead. I ran to the back and got some water, but I could not bring\r\nher to. Then I went round the corner to the Ivy Plant for some brandy,\r\nand by the time I had brought it back the young woman had recovered and\r\nwas off--ashamed of herself, I dare say, and dared not face me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about moving that drugget?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, it was a bit rumpled, certainly, when I came back. You see,\r\nshe fell on it, and it lies on a polished floor with nothing to keep it\r\nin place. I straightened it out afterwards.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a lesson to you that you can't deceive me, Constable MacPherson,\"\r\nsaid Lestrade, with dignity. \"No doubt you thought that your breach of\r\nduty could never be discovered, and yet a mere glance at that drugget\r\nwas enough to convince me that someone had been admitted to the room.\r\nIt's lucky for you, my man, that nothing is missing, or you would find\r\nyourself in Queer Street. I'm sorry to have called you down over such a\r\npetty business, Mr. Holmes, but I thought the point of the second stain\r\nnot corresponding with the first would interest you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, it was most interesting. Has this woman only been here once,\r\nconstable?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, only once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was she?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know the name, sir. Was answering an advertisement about\r\ntype-writing, and came to the wrong number--very pleasant, genteel young\r\nwoman, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tall? Handsome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; she was a well-grown young woman. I suppose you might say\r\nshe was handsome. Perhaps some would say she was very handsome. 'Oh,\r\nofficer, do let me have a peep!' says she. She had pretty, coaxing ways,\r\nas you might say, and I thought there was no harm in letting her just\r\nput her head through the door.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was she dressed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet, sir--a long mantle down to her feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was just growing dusk at the time. They were lighting the lamps as I\r\ncame back with the brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Holmes. \"Come, Watson, I think that we have more\r\nimportant work elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nAs we left the house Lestrade remained in the front room, while the\r\nrepentant constable opened the door to let us out. Holmes turned on the\r\nstep and held up something in his hand. The constable stared intently.\r\n\r\n\"Good Lord, sir!\" he cried, with amazement on his face. Holmes put his\r\nfinger on his lips, replaced his hand in his breast-pocket, and burst\r\nout laughing as we turned down the street. \"Excellent!\" said he. \"Come,\r\nfriend Watson, the curtain rings up for the last act. You will be\r\nrelieved to hear that there will be no war, that the Right Honourable\r\nTrelawney Hope will suffer no set-back in his brilliant career, that the\r\nindiscreet Sovereign will receive no punishment for his indiscretion,\r\nthat the Prime Minister will have no European complication to deal with,\r\nand that with a little tact and management upon our part nobody will be\r\na penny the worse for what might have been a very ugly incident.\"\r\n\r\nMy mind filled with admiration for this extraordinary man.\r\n\r\n\"You have solved it!\" I cried.\r\n\r\n\"Hardly that, Watson. There are some points which are as dark as ever.\r\nBut we have so much that it will be our own fault if we cannot get the\r\nrest. We will go straight to Whitehall Terrace and bring the matter to a\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the residence of the European Secretary it was for\r\nLady Hilda Trelawney Hope that Sherlock Holmes inquired. We were shown\r\ninto the morning-room.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes!\" said the lady, and her face was pink with her indignation,\r\n\"this is surely most unfair and ungenerous upon your part. I desired,\r\nas I have explained, to keep my visit to you a secret, lest my husband\r\nshould think that I was intruding into his affairs. And yet you\r\ncompromise me by coming here and so showing that there are business\r\nrelations between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, madam, I had no possible alternative. I have been\r\ncommissioned to recover this immensely important paper. I must therefore\r\nask you, madam, to be kind enough to place it in my hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe lady sprang to her feet, with the colour all dashed in an instant\r\nfrom her beautiful face. Her eyes glazed--she tottered--I thought that\r\nshe would faint. Then with a grand effort she rallied from the shock,\r\nand a supreme astonishment and indignation chased every other expression\r\nfrom her features.\r\n\r\n\"You--you insult me, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, madam, it is useless. Give up the letter.\"\r\n\r\nShe darted to the bell.\r\n\r\n\"The butler shall show you out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not ring, Lady Hilda. If you do, then all my earnest efforts to\r\navoid a scandal will be frustrated. Give up the letter and all will be\r\nset right. If you will work with me I can arrange everything. If you\r\nwork against me I must expose you.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood grandly defiant, a queenly figure, her eyes fixed upon his as\r\nif she would read his very soul. Her hand was on the bell, but she had\r\nforborne to ring it.\r\n\r\n\"You are trying to frighten me. It is not a very manly thing, Mr.\r\nHolmes, to come here and browbeat a woman. You say that you know\r\nsomething. What is it that you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray sit down, madam. You will hurt yourself there if you fall. I will\r\nnot speak until you sit down. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I give you five minutes, Mr. Holmes.\"\r\n\r\n\"One is enough, Lady Hilda. I know of your visit to Eduardo Lucas, of\r\nyour giving him this document, of your ingenious return to the room\r\nlast night, and of the manner in which you took the letter from the\r\nhiding-place under the carpet.\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at him with an ashen face and gulped twice before she could\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, Mr. Holmes--you are mad!\" she cried, at last.\r\n\r\nHe drew a small piece of cardboard from his pocket. It was the face of a\r\nwoman cut out of a portrait.\r\n\r\n\"I have carried this because I thought it might be useful,\" said he.\r\n\"The policeman has recognised it.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a gasp and her head dropped back in the chair.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Lady Hilda. You have the letter. The matter may still be\r\nadjusted. I have no desire to bring trouble to you. My duty ends when\r\nI have returned the lost letter to your husband. Take my advice and be\r\nfrank with me; it is your only chance.\"\r\n\r\nHer courage was admirable. Even now she would not own defeat.\r\n\r\n\"I tell you again, Mr. Holmes, that you are under some absurd illusion.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for you, Lady Hilda. I have done my best for you; I can see\r\nthat it is all in vain.\"\r\n\r\nHe rang the bell. The butler entered.\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Trelawney Hope at home?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will be home, sir, at a quarter to one.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes glanced at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"Still a quarter of an hour,\" said he. \"Very good, I shall wait.\"\r\n\r\nThe butler had hardly closed the door behind him when Lady Hilda\r\nwas down on her knees at Holmes's feet, her hands out-stretched, her\r\nbeautiful face upturned and wet with her tears.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, spare me, Mr. Holmes! Spare me!\" she pleaded, in a frenzy of\r\nsupplication. \"For Heaven's sake, don't tell him! I love him so! I would\r\nnot bring one shadow on his life, and this I know would break his noble\r\nheart.\"\r\n\r\nHolmes raised the lady. \"I am thankful, madam, that you have come to\r\nyour senses even at this last moment! There is not an instant to lose.\r\nWhere is the letter?\"\r\n\r\nShe darted across to a writing-desk, unlocked it, and drew out a long\r\nblue envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, Mr. Holmes. Would to Heaven I had never seen it!\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we return it?\" Holmes muttered. \"Quick, quick, we must think of\r\nsome way! Where is the despatch-box?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still in his bedroom.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a stroke of luck! Quick, madam, bring it here!\"\r\n\r\nA moment later she had appeared with a red flat box in her hand.\r\n\r\n\"How did you open it before? You have a duplicate key? Yes, of course\r\nyou have. Open it!\"\r\n\r\nFrom out of her bosom Lady Hilda had drawn a small key. The box flew\r\nopen. It was stuffed with papers. Holmes thrust the blue envelope deep\r\ndown into the heart of them, between the leaves of some other document.\r\nThe box was shut, locked, and returned to the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are ready for him,\" said Holmes; \"we have still ten minutes.\r\nI am going far to screen you, Lady Hilda. In return you will spend\r\nthe time in telling me frankly the real meaning of this extraordinary\r\naffair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, I will tell you everything,\" cried the lady. \"Oh, Mr.\r\nHolmes, I would cut off my right hand before I gave him a moment of\r\nsorrow! There is no woman in all London who loves her husband as I\r\ndo, and yet if he knew how I have acted--how I have been compelled to\r\nact--he would never forgive me. For his own honour stands so high that\r\nhe could not forget or pardon a lapse in another. Help me, Mr. Holmes!\r\nMy happiness, his happiness, our very lives are at stake!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick, madam, the time grows short!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a letter of mine, Mr. Holmes, an indiscreet letter written\r\nbefore my marriage--a foolish letter, a letter of an impulsive, loving\r\ngirl. I meant no harm, and yet he would have thought it criminal. Had he\r\nread that letter his confidence would have been for ever destroyed.\r\nIt is years since I wrote it. I had thought that the whole matter was\r\nforgotten. Then at last I heard from this man, Lucas, that it had passed\r\ninto his hands, and that he would lay it before my husband. I implored\r\nhis mercy. He said that he would return my letter if I would bring him a\r\ncertain document which he described in my husband's despatch-box. He had\r\nsome spy in the office who had told him of its existence. He assured me\r\nthat no harm could come to my husband. Put yourself in my position, Mr.\r\nHolmes! What was I to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Take your husband into your confidence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I could not, Mr. Holmes, I could not! On the one side seemed certain\r\nruin; on the other, terrible as it seemed to take my husband's paper,\r\nstill in a matter of politics I could not understand the consequences,\r\nwhile in a matter of love and trust they were only too clear to me.\r\nI did it, Mr. Holmes! I took an impression of his key; this man Lucas\r\nfurnished a duplicate. I opened his despatch-box, took the paper, and\r\nconveyed it to Godolphin Street.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened there, madam?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tapped at the door as agreed. Lucas opened it. I followed him into\r\nhis room, leaving the hall door ajar behind me, for I feared to be alone\r\nwith the man. I remember that there was a woman outside as I entered.\r\nOur business was soon done. He had my letter on his desk; I handed him\r\nthe document. He gave me the letter. At this instant there was a sound\r\nat the door. There were steps in the passage. Lucas quickly turned\r\nback the drugget, thrust the document into some hiding-place there, and\r\ncovered it over.\r\n\r\n\"What happened after that is like some fearful dream. I have a vision of\r\na dark, frantic face, of a woman's voice, which screamed in French, 'My\r\nwaiting is not in vain. At last, at last I have found you with her!'\r\nThere was a savage struggle. I saw him with a chair in his hand, a knife\r\ngleamed in hers. I rushed from the horrible scene, ran from the house,\r\nand only next morning in the paper did I learn the dreadful result. That\r\nnight I was happy, for I had my letter, and I had not seen yet what the\r\nfuture would bring.\r\n\r\n\"It was the next morning that I realized that I had only exchanged one\r\ntrouble for another. My husband's anguish at the loss of his paper went\r\nto my heart. I could hardly prevent myself from there and then kneeling\r\ndown at his feet and telling him what I had done. But that again would\r\nmean a confession of the past. I came to you that morning in order to\r\nunderstand the full enormity of my offence. From the instant that I\r\ngrasped it my whole mind was turned to the one thought of getting back\r\nmy husband's paper. It must still be where Lucas had placed it, for it\r\nwas concealed before this dreadful woman entered the room. If it had not\r\nbeen for her coming, I should not have known where his hiding-place was.\r\nHow was I to get into the room? For two days I watched the place, but\r\nthe door was never left open. Last night I made a last attempt. What I\r\ndid and how I succeeded, you have already learned. I brought the paper\r\nback with me, and thought of destroying it since I could see no way of\r\nreturning it, without confessing my guilt to my husband. Heavens, I hear\r\nhis step upon the stair!\"\r\n\r\nThe European Secretary burst excitedly into the room.\r\n\r\n\"Any news, Mr. Holmes, any news?\" he cried.\r\n\r\n\"I have some hopes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, thank heaven!\" His face became radiant. \"The Prime Minister is\r\nlunching with me. May he share your hopes? He has nerves of steel, and\r\nyet I know that he has hardly slept since this terrible event. Jacobs,\r\nwill you ask the Prime Minister to come up? As to you, dear, I fear that\r\nthis is a matter of politics. We will join you in a few minutes in the\r\ndining-room.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister's manner was subdued, but I could see by the gleam\r\nof his eyes and the twitchings of his bony hands that he shared the\r\nexcitement of his young colleague.\r\n\r\n\"I understand that you have something to report, Mr. Holmes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Purely negative as yet,\" my friend answered. \"I have inquired at every\r\npoint where it might be, and I am sure that there is no danger to be\r\napprehended.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that is not enough, Mr. Holmes. We cannot live for ever on such a\r\nvolcano. We must have something definite.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am in hopes of getting it. That is why I am here. The more I think of\r\nthe matter the more convinced I am that the letter has never left this\r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it had it would certainly have been public by now.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why should anyone take it in order to keep it in his house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not convinced that anyone did take it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how could it leave the despatch-box?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not convinced that it ever did leave the despatch-box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Holmes, this joking is very ill-timed. You have my assurance that\r\nit left the box.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you examined the box since Tuesday morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; it was not necessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may conceivably have overlooked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am not convinced of it; I have known such things to happen. I\r\npresume there are other papers there. Well, it may have got mixed with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was on the top.\"\r\n\r\n\"Someone may have shaken the box and displaced it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no; I had everything out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it is easily decided, Hope,\" said the Premier. \"Let us have the\r\ndespatch-box brought in.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary rang the bell.\r\n\r\n\"Jacobs, bring down my despatch-box. This is a farcical waste of time,\r\nbut still, if nothing else will satisfy you, it shall be done. Thank\r\nyou, Jacobs; put it here. I have always had the key on my watch-chain.\r\nHere are the papers, you see. Letter from Lord Merrow, report from Sir\r\nCharles Hardy, memorandum from Belgrade, note on the Russo-German grain\r\ntaxes, letter from Madrid, note from Lord Flowers--good heavens! what is\r\nthis? Lord Bellinger! Lord Bellinger!\"\r\n\r\nThe Premier snatched the blue envelope from his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is it--and the letter is intact. Hope, I congratulate you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you! Thank you! What a weight from my heart. But this is\r\ninconceivable--impossible. Mr. Holmes, you are a wizard, a sorcerer! How\r\ndid you know it was there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I knew it was nowhere else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot believe my eyes!\" He ran wildly to the door. \"Where is my\r\nwife? I must tell her that all is well. Hilda! Hilda!\" we heard his\r\nvoice on the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe Premier looked at Holmes with twinkling eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Come, sir,\" said he. \"There is more in this than meets the eye. How\r\ncame the letter back in the box?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes turned away smiling from the keen scrutiny of those wonderful\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"We also have our diplomatic secrets,\" said he, and picking up his hat\r\nhe turned to the door.\r\n"}
