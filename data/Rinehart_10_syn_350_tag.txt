the 'no thoroughfare' <sign|mark> be up."  she sit there for fifteen <minute|hour>, interrupt by occasional noisy excursion from the nursery, which result in her acquire by degree a lapful of break wheel, three-legged horse and a live water beetle which the boy have find under the kitchen sink and <imprison|gaol> in a glass top box, where, to it bewilderment, they be assiduously offer it dead and mangle fly. but our last five minute be undisturbed, and the girl bring out with an effort the request she have try to make all day.  "whoever kill my father--and it be murder, mr. knox--whoever do it be go free to <save|keep> a scandal. all my--friend"--she smile bitterly--"be afraid of the same <thing|affair>. but i can not sit quiet and <think|remember> nothing can <be|follow> do. <i|single> _must_ know, and you be the only one who <seem|appear> will to try to find out."  so it be, that, when i <leave|allow> the <house|sign> a half hour later, i be commit. i have be commission by the girl i love--for it have come to that--to clear her lover of her father's murder, and so give him back to her--not in so many word, but i <be|follow> to follow up the crime, and the rest follow. and i be morally certain of two thing--first, that her lover be not worthy of her, and second, and more to the point, that innocent or guilty, he be indirectly implicate in the crime.  i have promise her also to see miss letitia that day if i could, and i turn over the event of the precede night a i walk toward the station, but <i|single> make nothing of them. one thing occur to me, <however|yet>. bella have tell margery that i have be up all night. could bella--? but i dismiss the think a absurd--bella, who have scuttle to bed in a panic of fright, would never have dare the lower floor <alone|lonely>, and bella, give all the courage in the world, could never have move with the swiftness and light certainty of my midnight prowler. it <have|make> not be bella.  but after all i do not go to bellwood. i meet hunter on my way to the station, and he turn around and walk with me.  "so you've lie down on the case!" i say, when we have go a few step without speak.  he grumble something unintelligible and probably unrepeatable.  "of <course|trend>," i persist, "be a simple and uncomplicated case of suicide, there be nothing in it anyhow. if it have <be|follow> a murder, under peculiar circumstance--"  he stop and grip my arm.  "for ten cent," he say gravely, "i would tell the <chief|principal> and a few others what i think of them. and <then|so> i'd go out and get full."  "not on ten cent!"  "i'm go out of the business," he storm. "i'm go to drive a garbage wagon: it's <cleaner|white> than this <job|business>. suicide! i never saw a cleaner case of--" he stop suddenly. "do you know burton--of the _times-post_?"  "no: i've hear of him."  "well, he's your man. they're dead against the ring, and burton's be give the case. he's a sharp a a steel <trap|ambush>. you two get together."  he pause at a corner. "good-by," he say dejectedly. "i'm off to <hunt|run> some boy that have be steal milk bottle. that's about my size, these day." he turn around, however, before he have go many step and come back.  "wardrop have be miss since yesterday afternoon," he say. "that be, he think he's miss. we've get him all right."  i give up my bellwood visit for the time, and take a car down-town, i go to the _times-post_ office. the monday morning edition be already under way, a far a the staff be concern, and from the <wait|look>-room i could <see|ensure> three or four men, with their hat on, most of them rattle typewriter. <burton|Sir_Richard_Burton> come in in a <moment|instant>, a red-haired young fellow, with a short thick nose and a muggy skin. he be rather stocky in build, and the pugnacity of his feature do not hide the <shrewdness|astuteness> of his eye.  i introduce myself, and at my name his perfunctory manner change.  "knox!" he say. "i call you last night over the 'phone."  "can't we talk in a more private place?" i <ask|expect>, try to raise my voice above the confusion of the next <room|board>. in reply he take me into a tiny office, contain a desk and two chair, and separate by an eight-foot partition from the other room.  "this be the <best|effective> we <have|take>," he explain cheerfully. "newspaper be agent of publicity, not privacy--if you don't care what you say."  i like burton. there <be|follow> something genuine about him; after wardrop's kid-glove finish, he be a relief.  "hunter, of the <detective|investigator> bureau, send me here," i proceed, "about the fleming case."  he <take|remove> out his note-book. "you be the fourth to-day," he say. "hunter himself, lightfoot from plattsburg, and mcfeely here in <town|township>. well, mr. knox, be you will now to put yourself <on|along> record that <fleming|Alexander_Fleming> commit suicide?"  "no," i say firmly. "it be my <belief|impression> that he be <murder|dispatch>."  "and that the secretary fellow, what's his name?--wardrop?--that he kill him?"  "possibly."  in reply <burton|Richard_Burton> fumble in his <pocket|bag> and bring up a pasteboard box, fill with jeweler's cotton. underneath be a <small|little> object, which he pas to me with <care|worry>.  "i get it from the coroner's physician, who perform the <autopsy|postmortem_examination>," he say casually. "you will notice that it be a thirty-two, and that the revolver they take from wardrop be a thirty-eight. question, where's the other <gun|gas>?"  i give him back the bullet, and he roll it around on the palm of his hand.  "little <thing|affair>, isn't it?" he say. "we <think|remember> we're lord of <creation|origination>, until we <see|find> a quarter-inch bichloride tablet, or a bite of lead like this. look here." he dive into his <pocket|bag> again and draw out a roll of ordinary brown paper. when he <open|give> it a bite of white chalk fell on the desk.  "look at that," he say dramatically. "kill an army with it, and they'd never know what strike them. cyanide of potassium--and the druggist that sell it ought to be choke."  "where do it come from?" i ask curiously. burton smile his cheerful smile.  "it's a beautiful case, all around," he say, a he get his hat. "i haven't have any sunday dinner yet, and it's five o'clock. oh--the cyanide? clarkson, the cashier of the bank fleming <ruin|destroy>, take a <bite|prick> off that corner right there, this morning."  "clarkson!" i exclaim. "how be he?"  "god <only|just> know," say burton <gravely|badly>, from which i take it clarkson be dead.      burton <listen|hear> while he eat, and his cheerful comment <be|follow> welcome enough after the depression of the last few <day|daylight>. i tell him, after some <hesitation|falter>, the whole thing, begin with the maitland pearl and end with my drop down the dumb-waiter. i know i be absolutely <safe|good> in <do|come> so: there be no person to whom i would rather tell a secret than a newspaper <man|world>. he will go out of his <way|room> to keep it: he will lock it in the depth of his bosom, and keep it until seventy time seven. <also|too>, you may threaten the rack or offer a larger salary, the seal do not <come|get> off his lip until the <word|countersign> be give. if then he make a scarehead of it, and get in three column of space and a many photograph, it be his just reward.  so--i tell <burton|Sir_Richard_Francis_Burton> everything, and he eat enough beefsteak for two <men|human>, and miss not a word i say.  "the money wardrop <have|get> in the <grip|clutch>--that's easy enough explain," he say. "fleming use the borough bank to deposit state fund in. he must have know it be rotten: he and clarkson be a thick a thieve. accord to a <time|clip>-honor custom in our land of the brave and home of the free, a state treasurer who be crook can, in such a case, draw on such a bank without security, on his personal note, which be usually worth it <value|esteem> by the <pound|hammer> a old paper."  "and fleming do that?"  "he do. <then|so> thing <get|make> bad at the borough bank. fleming have have to divide with schwartz and the <lord|master> only know who all, but it <be|follow> fleming who have to put in the money to avert a crash--the word crash be synonymous with scandal in this <case|face>. he scrap together a paltry hundred thousand, which wardrop <get|become> at the capital, and bring on. wardrop be rob, or say he be: the bank collapse and clarkson, drive to the wall, kill himself, just after <fleming|Alexander_Fleming> be murder. what do that sound like?"  "like clarkson!" i exclaim. "and clarkson know fleming <be|follow> hide at the white <cat|sick>!"  "now, then, take the other theory," he say, push <aside|away> his cup. "wardrop go in to fleming with a story that he have be rob: fleming get crazy and attack him. all that <be|follow> in the morning--friday. now, then--wardrop go back there that night. within twenty minute after he enter the club he rush out, and when hunter follow him, he say he be look for a doctor, to get cocaine for a gentleman up-stair. he be white and tremble. they go back together, and find you there, and <fleming|Fleming> <dead|short>. wardrop <tell|say> two story: first he say fleming commit suicide just before he leave. then he change it and say he be dead when he arrive there. he produce the weapon with which fleming be suppose to have kill himself, and which, by the way, miss fleming identify yesterday a her father's. but there be two discrepancy. wardrop practically admit that he have take that revolver from fleming, not that night, but the morning before, during the quarrel."  "and the other discrepancy?"  "the bullet. nobody ever fire a thirty-two bullet out of a thirty-eight caliber revolver--unless he be try to shoot a double-compound curve. <now|instantly>, then, who do it look like?"  "like wardrop," i confess. "by jove, they didn't both <do|make> it."  "and he didn't do it himself for two good reason: he have no revolver that night, and there be no powder mark."  "and the eleven twenty-two, and <miss|lose> maitland's disappearance?"  he look at me with his quizzical <smile|grin>.  "i'll have to have another steak, if i'm to settle that," he say. "i can only solve one murder on one steak. but <disappearance|fade> be my specialty; perhaps, if i have a <piece|composition> of pie and some cheese--"  but i get him away at last, and we walk together down the street.  "i can't quite see the old lady in it," he confess. "she hadn't any grudge against fleming, <have|let> she? wouldn't be likely to <forget|leave> herself temporarily and kill him?"  "good lord!" i say. "why, she's sixty-five, and a timid and gentle a little old lady a ever live."  "curl?" he <ask|take>, turn his bright blue <eye|centre> on me.  "yes," i admit.  "wouldn't be likely to <have|give> elope with the minister, or <advertise|push> for a husband, or anything like that?"  "you would have to know her to understand," i say resignedly. "but she didn't <do|make> any of those thing, and she didn't run off to join a theatrical troupe. burton, who do you think be in the fleming house last night?"  "lightfoot," he say succinctly.  he stop under a street lamp and look at his watch.  "i believe i'll run over to the capital to-night," he say. "while i'm go--i'll be back to-morrow <night|dark> or the next morning--i wish you would do two thing. find rosie o'grady, or whatever her name be, and locate carter. that's probably not his name, but it will answer for a while. then get your friend hunter to keep him in sight for a while, until i <come|do> back anyhow. i'm begin to enjoy this; it's more fun than a picture puzzle. we're go to <make|give> the police department look like a kindergarten play jackstraw."  "and the second thing i be to do?"  "go to bellwood and find out a few thing. it's all <well|considerably> enough to say the old lady be a <meek|mild> and timid person, but if you want to <know|recognize> her peculiarity, go to her neighbor. when <people|mass> leave the beat <path|route>, the neighbor <always|incessantly> know it before the <family|class>."  he stop before a <drug|dose>-store.  "i'll have to pack for my little jaunt," he say, and purchase a tooth-brush, which prove to be the extent of his preparation. we separate at the station, burton to take his red hair and his tooth-brush to plattsburg, i to take a taxicab, and arm with a page tear from the classify directory to inquire at a many of the twelve anderson's drug-store a might be <necessary|essential> to locate delia's gentleman friend, "the clerk," through him delia, and through delia, the mysterious carter, "who be not really a butler."  it occur to me <somewhat|pretty> tardily, that i know nothing of delia but her give name. a telephone talk with margery be of little <assistance|assist>: delia <have|get> be a new maid, and if she have hear her other name, she have forget it.  i have check off eight of the anderson on my list, without result, and the taximeter show something over nineteen dollar, when the driver <draw|get> up at the curb.  "gentleman in the other cab be hail you, sir," he say over his shoulder.  "the other cab?"  "the one that <have|get> be follow u."  i open the door and glance behind. a duplicate of my cab stand perhaps fifty foot behind, and from it a familiar figure be slowly emerge, carry on a high-pitch <argument|tilt> with the chauffeur. the figure stop to read the taximeter, shake his fist at the <chauffeur|drive_around>, and approach me, mutter audibly. it be davidson.  "that liar and thief back there have get me ring up for nineteen dollar," he say, ignore my amazement. "nineteen dollar and forty cent! he must <have|take> the thing <count|matter> the <revolution|rotation> of all four wheel!"  he walk around and survey my expense <account|history>, at the driver's elbow. then he hit the <meter|cadence> a smart slap, but the figure do not change.  "nineteen dollar!" he repeat daze. "nineteen dollar and--look here," he call to his driver, who have <bring|add> the cab close, "it's <only|entirely> thirty cent here. your clock's ten cent fast."  "but how--" i begin.  "you back up to nineteen dollar and thirty cent," he persist, ignore me. "if you'll back up to twelve dollar, i'll pay it. that's all i've <get|have>." then he turn on me irritably. "good heaven, man," he exclaim, "do you mean to tell me you've be to eight drug-<store|stock> this sunday even and spend nineteen dollar and thirty cent, and haven't get a drink yet?"  "<do|make> you <think|believe> i'm after a drink?" i ask him. "now look here, davidson, i rather think you know what i be after. if you don't, it doesn't matter. but since you be come along anyhow, pay your <man|world> off and come with me. i don't like to <be|follow> follow."  he agree without hesitation, borrow eight <dollar|buck> from me to augment his twelve and crawl in with me.  "the next address on the list be the right one," he say, a the man <wait|hold> for direction. "i do the same round yesterday, but not be a plutocrat, i use the street-car and my leg. and because you're a decent fellow and don't have to be chloroform to have an idea <inject|interpose>, i'm go to tell you something. there be eleven roundsman a well a the sergeant who hear me read the note i <find|see> at the fleming house that night. you may have count them through the window. a <dozen|twelve> plain-clothe men read it before morning. when the <news|intelligence> of mr. fleming's mur--death come out, i think this <fellow|familiar> carter might know something, and <i|single> trail delia through this mamie brennan. when i get there i <find|happen> tom brannigan and four <other|former> detective sit in the parlor, and miss delia, in a blue silk waist, make eye at every mother's son of them."  i laugh in <spite|malice> of my disappointment. davidson lean forward and close the window at the driver's back. then he square around and face me.  "understand me, mr. knox," he say, "mr. fleming kill himself. you and i be agree on that. even if you aren't just convince of it i'm tell you, and--better let it drop, sir," under his quiet manner i felt a threat: it serve to rouse me.  "i'll let it drop when i'm through with it," i assert, and get out my list of address.  "you'll let it drop because it's too hot to hold," he retort, with the suspicion of a smile. "if you be determine to know about carter, i can tell you everything that be necessary."  the chauffeur stop his engine with an exasperate jerk and settle down in his seat, every line of his <back|second> bristle with <irritation|vexation>.  "i prefer <learn|hear> from carter himself."  he lean back in his seat and produce an apple from the pocket of his coat.  "you'll have to travel some to do it, son," he say. "carter leave for part unknown last night, <take|acquire> with him enough money to keep him in <comfort|puff> for some little time."  "until all this blow over," i say bitterly.  "the trip be for the benefit of his health. he have be suffer--and be still <suffer|lose>, from a curious <lapse|sink> of memory." davidson smile at me engagingly. "he have <entirely|alone> forget everything that occur from the time he enter mr. fleming's employment, until that gentleman <leave|allow> home. i doubt if he <will|leave> ever recover."  with carter go, his <retreat|withdraw> cover by the police, supply with fund from some problematical source, further search for him be <worse|big> than useless. in fact, davidson strongly intimate that it might be dangerous and would be <certainly|surely> unpleasant. i <yield|relent> <ungraciously|gracelessly> and order the cab to take me home. but on the <way|manner> i curse my folly for not have follow this obvious clue earlier, and i wonder what this <thing|affair> could be that carter <know|recognize>, that be at least surmise by various headquarter men, and yet be <so|thus> carefully hide from the world at large.  the party <newspaper|paper> have come out that day with a sign statement from mr. fleming's physician in plattsburg that he have be in ill health and incline to melancholia for some time. the air be thick with rumor of difference with his party: the dust <cloud|befog> cover everything; pretty soon it would settle and hide the track of those who <have|give> hurry to cover under it protection.  davidson leave me at a corner down-town. he <turn|go> to give me a part admonition.  "there's an old axiom in the mill around here, 'never sit down on a piece of metal until you spit on it.' if it sizzle, don't sit." he grin. "your best position just now, young man, <be|follow> stand, with your hand over your head. confidentially, there ain't anything within expectorate distance just now that ain't pretty well het up."  he leave me with that, and i do not see him again until the night at the white <cat|chuck>, when he help put me through the transom. recently, however, i have meet him several time. he invariably mention the eight dollar and his intention of repay it. unfortunately, the desire and the ability have not yet happen to coincide.  i take the even train to bellwood, and get there shortly after eight, in the midst of the sunday even calm, and the calm of a <place|rank> like bellwood be the peace of death without the hope of <resurrection|Resurrection>.  i walk slowly up the main street, which be <line|job> with residence; the town relegate it few shop to le desirable neighborhood. my first <intention|intent> have be to see the episcopal minister, but the rectory be <dark|black>, and a burst of organ <music|medicine> from the church near remind me again of the sunday <even|yet> service.  promiscuous inquiry be not advisable. so far, miss jane's disappearance be know to very few, and hunter <have|make> advise caution. i wander up the street and turn at random to the right; a few door ahead a newish red brick build proclaim itself the post-office, and give the only sign of life in the neighborhood. it occur to me that here inside be the one individual who, theoretically at least, in a small place <always|forever> know the idiosyncrasy of it <people|multitude>.  the door be partly open, for the spring <night|dark> <be|follow> sultry. <i|single> think i hear something move behind me in the cabin, and wheel sharply, hold my revolver level.  the idea have come to me that the crew have mutiny, and that every one in the after house have be kill.  the idea make me frantic; i <think|guess> of the woman, of elsa lee, and i be ready to kill.  "where be the light <switch|shift>?" <i|single> <demand|need> of singleton, who be still on the companion step, sway.  "i don't know," he say, and collapse, sit huddle just above the captain's body, with his face in his <hand|reach>.  i <saw|find> i <need|take> not look to him for help, and i succeed in turn on the light in the swing lamp in the center of the cabin.  there be no sign of any <struggle|contend>, and the cabin be empty.  i go back to the captain's body, and throw a rug over it.  then i reach over and shake singleton by the arm.  "do something!" i rave.  "call the crew.  get somebody here, you drunken fool!"  he rise and stagger up the companionway, and i run to miss lee's door.  it be close and lock, a be all the others except vail's and the one i have break open.  i reach mr. turner's <door|threshold> <last|final>.  it be lock, and <i|single> <get|take> no response to my knock.  i remember that his room and vail's connect through a bath, and, still hold my revolver level, i run into vail's room again, this time turn <on|along> the light.  a night light be burn in the bath-room, and the door beyond <be|follow> unlock.  i fling it open and step in.  turner <be|follow> lie on his <bed|retire>, fully dress, and at first i think he too have <be|follow> murder. but he be in a drunken <stupor|semiconsciousness>.  he sit up, <daze|haze>, when i shake him by the arm.  "mr. turner!" i cry.  "try to rouse yourself, man!  the <captain|master> have be murder, and mr. vail!"  he make an effort to sit up, sway, and fell back again.  his <face|look> be swell and purplish, his eye congest.  he make an effort to speak, but fail to be intelligible.  i <have|give> no time to waste. somewhere <on|along> the ella the murderer be loose.  he must be find.  i fling out of turner's cabin a the crew, <gather|gain> from the forecastle and from the deck, crowd down the forward companionway. i run my eye over them.  every man <be|follow> there, singleton below by the captain's body, the crew, silent and horror-strike, group <on|along> the step: clarke, mcnamara, burn, oleson, and adam.  behind the crew, charlie jones have <leave|will> the wheel and stand peer down, until sharply order back. williams, with a bandage on his head, and tom, the mulatto cook, be in the group.  i stand, revolver in hand, star at the men.  among them, i <felt|find> <sure|certain>, be the murderer.  but which one?  all be equally pale, equally <terrify|terrorize>.  "boy," i say, "mr. vail and your captain have be murder.  the murderer must be on the ship--one of ourselves."  there be a <murmur|gnarl> at that.  "mr. singleton, i suggest that these men stay together in a body, and that no one be allow to go below until all have be search and all <weapon|artillery> take from them."  singleton have drop into a chair, and sit with his face bury in his hand, his <back|punt> to the captain's body.  he look up without move, and his face be gray.  "all right," he say.  "do a you like.  i'm sick."  he look sick.  burn, who have take schwartz's <place|aim> a second mate, leave the group and come toward me.  "we'd better waken the woman," he say.  "if you'll tell them, leslie, i'll take the crew on deck and keep them there."  singleton <seem|appear> daze, and when burn speak of take the men on deck, he get up dizzily.  "i'm go <too|likewise>," he mutter.  "i'll go crazy if i stay down here with that."  the rug have be draw back to show the crew what <have|let> happen. i draw it reverently over the body again.  after the men have go, <i|single> <knock|belt> at mr. turner's door.  it be some time before she rouse; when she answer, her <voice|part> be startle.  "what be it?"  "it's leslie, mr. turner.  will you come to the door?"  "in a moment."  she throw on a dress-gown, and <open|give> the door.  "what be wrong?"  <i|single> tell her, a gently a i could.  i think she would faint; but she pull herself together and <look|expect> past me into the cabin.  "that be--?"  "the captain, mr. turner."  "and mr. vail?"  "in his cabin."  "where be mr. turner?"  "in his cabin, asleep."  she look at me strangely, and, leave the <door|threshold>, go into her sister's room, next.  i <hear|see> miss lee's low cry of horror, and almost immediately the two woman come to the doorway.  "have you see mr. turner?" miss lee demand.  "just now."  "have mr. john be tell?"  "not yet."  she go herself to mr. johns's cabin, and knock.  she <get|let> an immediate answer, and mr. john, partly dress, open the door.  "what's the matter?" she demand.  "the whole crew be tramp outside my window.  i hope we haven't strike an iceberg."  "adele, don't faint, please.  something awful have happen."  "turner!  he have kill some one finally!"  "hush, for heaven's sake!  wilmer have be <murder|remove>, adele--and the captain."  mr. john have le control than the other woman.  she stand for an instant, with a sort of horrible grin on her face.  then she go down on the <floor|shock>, full length, with a crash.  elsa lee kneel beside her and slide a <pillow|rest> under her head.  "call the <maid|housemaid>, leslie," she say quietly.  "karen have something for this sort of thing.  tell her to bring it quickly."  i go the length of the cabin and into the chartroom.  the maids' room be here, on the port-side, and thus aft of mr. turner's and miss lee's room.  it have one door <only|merely>, and two small <bar|block> window, one above each of the two bunk.  i turn on the chart-room light.  at the top of the after companionway the crew have be assemble, and burn be harangue them.  i knock at the maids' door, and, find it unlock, open it an inch or <so|indeed>.  "karen!" i call--and, receive no answer: "mr. sloane!" (the stewardess).  i open the door wide and glance in.  karen hansen, the maid, be on the <floor|level>, dead.  the stewardess, in collapse from terror, be in her bunk, uninjured.      i go to the after companionway and call up to the <men|valet> to send the first mate down; but burn come instead.  "singleton's sick," he explain.  "he's up there in a corner, with oleson and mcnamara hold him."  "burn," i say cautiously--"i've <find|see> another!"  "<god|immortal>, not one of the woman!"  "one of the maid--<karen|Karenic>."  burn be a young fellow about my own age, and to this point he have stand up <well|intimately>.  but he have be <have|let> a <sort|class> of flirtation with the girl, and i saw him go sick with <horror|repulsion>.  he want to see her, when he have get <command|mastery> of himself; but i would not let him enter the room.  he stand outside, while i go in and <carry|run> out the <stewardess|hostess>, who <be|follow> come to and moan.  i take her forward, and tell the three woman there what i have find.  mr. john be <better|full>, and i find them all huddle in her room.  i put the stewardess on the bed, and lock the door into the next room. then, after examine the window, i give elsa lee my revolver.  "don't let any one in," i say.  "i'll put a guard at the two companionway, and we'll let no one down.  but keep the <door|threshold> lock also."  she <take|consider> the revolver from me, and examine it with the air of one familiar with firearm.  then she <look|appear> up at me, her lip a white a her face.  "we be rely on you, leslie," she say.  and, at her word, the storm of self-contempt and bitterness that i have be hold in abeyance for the last half hour sweep over me like a <flood|deluge>.  i could <have|get> weep for <fury|ferocity>.  "why should you trust me?" i demand.  "i sleep through the time when i be need.  and when i waken and <find|happen> myself lock in the storeroom, i wait to take the lock off instead of break down the door!  i ought to jump overboard."  "we be rely <on|along> you," she say again, simply; and i hear her fasten the door behind me a i go out.  dawn be <come|get> a i join the crew, huddle around the wheel. there be nine men, count singleton.  but singleton hardly count.  he be in a state of profound mental and physical collapse.  the ella be without an accredit officer, and, for lack of order to the contrary, the helmsman--mcnamara now--be hold her to her course.  burn have take schwartz's place a second <mate|twin>, but the situation be clearly beyond him.  turner's condition be know and frankly discus.  it <be|follow> clear that, for a time at least, we would have to get along without him.  charlie jones, always an influence among the men, voice the situation a we all stand together in the chill morning air:  "what we want to do, boy," he say, "be to make for the nearest port. this here be a police matter."  "and a hang matter," someone else put in.  "we've get to remember, boy, that this ain't like a crime on land. we've get the fellow that do it.  he's on the boat all <right|justly>."  there be a stir among the men, and some of them look aft to where, guard by the swede oleson, singleton be sit, his head in his hand.  "and, what's more," charlie jones go <on|along>, "i'm for put leslie here in charge--for now, anyhow.  that's agreeable to you, be it, burn?"  "but i don't know anything about a ship," i object.  "i'm will enough, but i'm not competent."  i believe the thing have be discus before i go up, for mcnamara speak up from the wheel.  "we'll manage that somehow or other, leslie," he say.  "we want somebody to take charge, somebody with a <head|principal>, that's all.  and since you ain't, in a manner of <speak|utter>, be one of u, nobody's feel can't <be|follow> hurt.  ain't that it, boy?"  "that, and a matter of brain," say burn.  "but singleton?" i glance aft.  "singleton be go in iron," be the <reply|respond> i get.  the light be stronger now, and i could see their <face|nerve>.  it be clear that the crew, or a majority of the crew, believe him guilty, and that, a far a singleton be concern, my authority do not exist.  "all right," i say.  "i'll do the best i can.  first of all, i want every man to give up his weapon.  burn!"  "aye, aye."  "go over each man.  leave them their pocket-knife; <take|remove> everything else."  the <men|world> line up.  the situation be tense, horrible, so that the miscellaneous article from their pocket--knife, key, plug of chew tobacco, and here and there, among the foreign one, small <comb|disentangle> for beard and mustache unexpectedly bring to light, cause a smile of <pure|complete> reaction.  two revolver from oleson and mcnamara and one nick razor from adam complete the list of weapon we find.  the crew submit willingly.  they seem relieve to <have|give> some one to direct them, and the alacrity with which they obey my order <show|establish> how they be suffer <under|below> the strain of inaction.  i go over to singleton and put my hand on his shoulder.  "i'm sorry, mr. singleton," i say, "but i'll have to ask you for your revolver."  without look at me, he draw it from his hip <pocket|sack> and hold it out. i take it: it be load.  "it's out of order," he say briefly.  "if it have <be|follow> work right, i wouldn't be here."  i reach down and touch his wrist.  his pulse be slow and rather faint, his hand cold.  "be there anything i can do for you?"  "yes," he snarl.  "you can get me a belay-pin and let me at those fool over there.  turner do this, and you know it a well a i do!"  i slide his revolver into my pocket, and go back to the men. count williams and the cook and myself, there <be|follow> nine of u. the cook i count out, order him to go to the <galley|caboose> and prepare breakfast. the eight that be leave i divide into two watch, <burn|bite> take one and i the other.  on burns's watch be clarke, mcnamara, and williams; on mine, oleson, adam, and charlie jones.  it <be|follow> two <bell|chime>, or five o'clock.  burn strike the gong sharply a an indication that order, of a sort, have be restore.  the <rise|raise> sun be gleam on the sail; the gray surface of the sea be ruffle under the morning breeze.  from the galley a thin stream of smoke be rise.  some of the horror of the night go with the darkness, but the think of what <wait|hold> in the cabin below be on u all.  i suggest another attempt to rouse mr. turner, and burn and clarke go below.  they come back in ten minute, report no <change|variety> in turner's condition.  there be open grumble among the men at the situation, but we be helpless.  burn and i decide to go on a if turner be not on board, until he be in condition to take <hold|book>.  we <think|believe> it best to bring up the body while all the crew be <on|along> duty, and then to take up the watch.  i arrange to <have|give> one man constantly on guard in the after house--a difficult matter where all be under suspicion.  burn suggest charlie jones a probably the most reliable, and i <give|have> him the revolver i <have|take> <take|make> from singleton. it be useless, but it <make|establish> at least a <show|indicate> of authority. the rest of the crew, except oleson, on guard over the mate, be detail to assist in <carry|contain> up the three body.  williams be take along to <get|take> sheet from the linen room.  we bring the captain up <first|low>, <lay|repose> him on a sheet on the deck and fold the edge over him.  it be terrible work.  <even|still> i, fresh from a medical college, grow nauseate over it.  he be heavy. it be slow work, get him up.  vail we bring up in the sheet from his bunk. of the three, he be the most mutilate.  the <maid|maiden> karen show only one injury, a smash blow on the head, probably from the head of the axe.  for axe it have be, beyond a doubt.  i put williams to <work|run> below to clear away every <evidence|show> of what have happen.  he go down, ashy-face, only to rush up again, refuse to stay alone.  i send clarke with him, and instruct charlie jones to keep them there until the cabin be in order.  at three bell the cook bring coffee, and some of the men take it. i try to swallow, but it choke me.  burn have <serve|do> a second mate on a sail vessel, and think he could <take|make> u back, at least into more travel water.  we decide to head back to new york.  i get the code book from the captain's cabin, and we agree to run up the flag, union down, if any other vessel come in <sight|deal>.  i get the code word for "mutiny--need assistance," and i ask the <mate|match> if he would signal if a vessel come near enough.  but he turn sullen and refuse to answer.  i find it hard to recap calmly the event of that morning: the three still and shroud figure, prone on deck; the crew, bareheaded, stand around, eye each other stealthily, with panic ready to leap free and grip each of them by the throat; the grim determination, the reason for which i do not yet know, to put the first <mate|pair> in iron; and, over all, the clear sunrise of an august morning on the ocean, rail and deck <gleam|glisten>, an odor of coffee in the air, the joyous <lift|elevation> and <splash|dab> of the bowsprit a the ella, head back on her course, seem to make for home like a nag for the stable.  <surely|certainly> none of these men, some weep, all grieve, could be the fiend who have commit the crime.  one by one, i <look|see> in their face--at burn, youngest member of the crew, a <blue|bluish>-eye, sandy-haired <scot|Scotsman>; at clarke and adam and charlie jones, old in the service of the turner line; at mcnamara, a shrewd little irishman; at oleson the swede.  and, in <spite|hurt> of myself, i could not help compare them with the <heavy|impenetrable>-shoulder, sodden-face man below in his cabin, the owner of the ship.  one explanation come to me, and i leap at it--the possibility of a stowaway hide in the hold, some maniacal fugitive who <have|take> find in the little <cargo|load> boat's empty hull ample room to hide.  the men, too, seize at the idea.  one and all volunteer for what might <prove|establish> to be a dangerous service.  i choose charlie jones and clarke a be most familiar with the <ship|send>, and we go down into the hold.  clarke carry a lantern.  charlie jones <hold|obtain> singleton's break revolver.  i carry a belay pin. but, although we search every foot of space, we <find|obtain> nothing.  the formaldehyde with which turner have fumigate the <ship|embark> cling here tenaciously, and, mix with the odor of bilge water and the indescribable heavy smell leave by tropical cargo, make me dizzy and ill.  we <be|follow> stumble along, clarke with the lantern, i next, and charlie jones behind, <on|along> our way to the ladder again, when i receive a stun blow on the back of the head.  i turn <dizzy|light-headed>, expect nothing le than sudden death, when it develop that jones, have stumble over a loose plank, <have|let> fall forward, the revolver in his outstretched hand strike my head.  he pick himself up sheepishly, and we go on.  but <so|thus> unnerve be i by this fresh shock that it be a moment or two before i could essay the ladder.  burn be wait at the <hatchway|scuttle>, peer down.  beside him on the <deck|floor> lay a bloodstained axe.  elsa lee, <on|along> hear the story of henrietta sloane, have go to the maids' cabin, and have <find|obtain> it where it have be fling into the berth of the stewardess.      but, after all, the story of henrietta sloane only add to the mystery.  she tell it to me, sit prop in a chair in mr. johns's room, her face white, her lip dry and twitch.  the crew be make such breakfast a they could on deck, and mr. turner be still in a stupor in his room across the main cabin.  the four woman, <draw|make> together in their <distress|hurt>, be huddle in the center of the room, touch hand now and then, a if find comfort in contact, and reassurance.  "i go to bed early," say the stewardess; "<about|around> ten o'clock, i <think|consider>.  karen have not come down; i waken when the <watch|picket> change. it <be|follow> hot, and the window from our <room|way> to the deck be <open|undecided>.  there be a <curtain|drape> over it, to keep the helmsman from look in--it <be|follow> close to the wheel.  the bell, strike every half-<hour|minute>, do not waken me any more, although it do at first.  it be just outside the window.  but i hear the <watch|sentinel> <change|alter>.  i hear eight bell <strike|tap>, and the <lookout|sentry> <man|human> on the forecastle head <call|predict>, 'all's well.'  "i sit up and turn on the light.  karen <have|let> not <come|follow> down, and i be alarm.  she have be--have be flirt a little with one of the sailor, and i have warn her that it would not do.  she'd be find out and get into trouble.  "the <only|solitary> way to reach our cabin be through the chart-room, and when i open the door an inch or two, i saw why karen <have|take> not come down.  mr. turner and mr. singleton be sit there.  they be--" she hesitate.  "please go on," say mr. turner.  "they be drink?"  "yes, mr. turner.  and mr. vail be there, too.  he be say that the captain would come down and there would be more trouble.  i shut the door and stand <just|hardly> inside, listen.  mr. singleton say he hop the captain would come--that he and mr. turner <only|simply> want a <chance|hazard> to get at him."  miss lee lean forward and search the stewardess's face with <strain|sift> eye.  "you be <sure|certain> that he mention mr. turner in that?"  "that <be|follow> exactly what he say, miss lee. she do not see mr. ladley at the time, but hear her in the next room. they <be|follow> apparently reconcile: mr. pitman report mr. ladley in high good humor. if the quarrel recommence during the <night|dark>, the other boarder, <name|call> reynolds, in the next room, hear nothing. mr. pitman be up and down until one o'clock, when she doze off. she hear no unusual sound.  "'at approximately two o'clock in the morning, however, this reynolds come to the room, and say he have hear some one in a boat in the <lower|humble> hall. he and mr. pitman investigate. the boat which mr. pitman use during a flood, and which she have tie to the <stair|step>-rail, be go, have be <cut|swing> <loose|promiscuous>, not untie. everything else be quiet, except that mr. ladley's dog have be shut in a third-story room.  "'at a <quarter|poop> after four that morning mr. pitman, thoroughly awake, hear the boat return, and go to the stair, meet ladley come in. he mutter something about have go for medicine for his wife and go to his <room|board>, shut the dog out. this be worth attention, for the dog ordinarily sleep in their room.'"  "what sort of a dog?" ask mr. howell. he <have|give> be listen attentively.  "a water-spaniel. 'the rest of the night, or early morning, be <quiet|repose>. at a <quarter|draw> after seven, ladley ask for coffee and toast for one, and on mr. pitman remark this, say that his wife be not play this week, and have go for a few days' vacation, have leave early in the morning.' <remember|commemorate>, during the night he have be out for <medicine|music> for her. now she <be|follow> able to travel, and, in fact, have start."  mr. howell be frown at the floor. "if he be do anything wrong, he be do it very badly," he say.  "this be where <i|single> enter the case," say mr. holcombe, "i row into the lower hall this morning, to fee the <dog|click>, peter, who be whine on the staircase. mr. pitman <be|follow> come down, pale and agitate over the fact that the dog, shortly before, have find float in the parlor down-stair a slipper belong to mr. ladley, and, later, a knife with a break blade. she maintain that she have the knife last night up-<stair|step>, that it be not break, and that it <be|follow> take from a shelf in her <room|way> while she doze. the question be, <then|so>: why be the knife take? who take it? and why? have this <man|human> make away with his wife, or have he not?"  mr. howell look at me and smile. "mr. holcombe and i be old enemy," he say. "mr. holcombe believe that circumstantial evidence may probably hang a man; i do not." and to mr. holcombe: "so, have <find|see> a wet slipper and a break knife, you be prepare for <murder|mutilate> and sudden death!"  "i have more evidence," mr. holcombe say eagerly, and proceed to <tell|say> what we have find in the room. mr. howell listen, smile to himself, but at the mention of the onyx clock he get up and go to the mantel.  "by jove!" he say, and stand look at the mark in the dust. "be you sure the clock be here yesterday?"  "i wind it night before last, and put the <key|central> underneath. yesterday, before they move up, i wind it again."  "the key be go also. well, what of it, holcombe? do he brain her with the clock? or choke her with the key?"  mr. holcombe be look at his <note|line>-book. "to summarize," he say, "we have here a <clue|hint> indicate a crime, the <rope|circle>, the break knife, the slipper, the towel, and the clock. besides, this scrap of paper may contain some information." he open it and sit gaze at it in his palm. then, "be this ladley's write?" he ask me in a curious voice.  "yes."  i glance at the slip. mr. holcombe <have|get> just read from his note-<book|reserve>: "rope, knife, slipper, towel, clock."  the slip i have find behind the wash-stand say "rope, knife, shoe, towel. horn--" the rest of the last word be tear off.  mr. howell be star at the <mantel|mantle>. "<clock|time>!" he repeat.      it be after four when mr. holcombe have finish go over the room. i offer to make both the gentleman some tea, for mr. pitman have be an englishman, and i have get into the <habit|use> of have a cup in the afternoon, with a cracker or a <bite|bit> of bread. but they refuse. mr. howell say he have promise to meet a lady, and to bring her through the flood district in a boat. he shake <hand|paw> with me, and smile at mr. holcombe.  "you will have to restrain his enthusiasm, mr. <pitman|Sir_Isaac_Pitman>," he say. "he be a bloodhound on the <scent|smell>. if his bay get on your <nerve|mettle>, just send for me." he go down the stair and step into the boat. "remember, holcombe," he call, "every well-constitute murder have two thing: a motive and a corpse. you haven't either, <only|merely> a mass of piffle detail--"  "if everybody wait until he <saw|realize> flame, instead of rely on the testimony of the <smoke|skunk>," mr. holcombe snap, "what would the fire loss be?"  mr. howell pole his boat to the front door, and sit down, prepare to row out.  "you <be|follow> warn, mr. pitman," he call to me. "if he doesn't find a body to fit the clue, he's quite capable of make one to fill the demand."  "horn--" say mr. holcombe, look at the slip again. "the tail of the 'n' be tear off--evidently only <part|function> of a <word|phrase>. hornet, horn, horner--mr. pitman, will you go with me to the police station?"  i be more than anxious to go. in fact, i could not bear the <idea|estimation> of stay alone in the <house|firm>, with heaven only know what conceal in the depth of that muddy flood. i <get|find> <on|along> my wrap again, and mr. holcombe row me out. peter plunge into the water to follow, and have to be send back. he sit on the lower step and <whine|whimper>. mr. holcombe throw him another piece of liver, but he do not touch it.  we row to the <corner|tree> of robinson street and federal--it be before federal street be raise above the flood level--and leave the boat in charge of a boy there. and we walk to the police station. on the way mr. holcombe question me closely about the event of the morning, and i recall the incident of the <burn|tan> pillow-slip. he make a note of it at once, and <grow|acquire> very thoughtful.  he leave me, however, at the police station. "i'd rather not appear in this, mr. pitman," he say apologetically, "and i <think|believe> better along my own line. not that i have anything against the police; they've do some splendid work. but this case take imagination, and the police department deal with fact. we have no fact <yet|even>. what we need, of course, be to have the man detain until we be sure of our <case|type>."  he lift his hat and turn away, and i go slowly up the <step|stair> to the police station. live, a i have, in a <neighborhood|region> where the police, like the <poor|pathetic>, be always with u, and where the visit of the patrol wagon be one of those familiar sight that no amount of repetition enable any of u to treat with <contempt|scorn>, i <be|follow> uncomfortable until i remember that my grandfather have be one of the <first|low> mayor of the city, and that, if the patrol have be at my house more than once, the entire neighborhood would testify that my boarder be usually orderly.  at the door some one touch me on the arm. it <be|follow> mr. holcombe again.  "i have be think it over," he say, "and i believe you'd better not mention the piece of <paper|composition> that you find behind the <wash|lap>-stand. they might say the whole thing be a hoax."  "very well," <i|single> agree, and go in.  the police sergeant in charge know me at once, have stop at my house more than once in flood-<time|clip> for a cup of hot coffee.  "sit down, mr. <pitman|collier>," he say. "i <suppose|theorize> you be still make the <best|respectable> coffee and doughnut in the city of allegheny? well, what's the trouble in your district? want an injunction against the river for trespass?"  "the river have <bring|add> me a <good|effective> <bite|prick> of trouble," i say. "i'm--i'm worry, mr. sergeant. i think a woman from my <house|family> have be murder, but i don't know."  "murder," he say, and draw up his chair. "tell me about it."  i tell him everything, while he sit back with his eye half close, and his finger beat a tattoo on the arm of his <chair|lead>.  when i finish he get up and go into an <inner|internal> room. he come back in a moment.  "i want you to come in and <tell|say> that to the chief," he say, and lead the way.  all <tell|say>, i repeat my story three <time|clip> that afternoon, to the sergeant, to the chief of police, and the third time to both the others and two detective.  the second time the chief make note of what i say.  "know this man ladley?" he ask the others. none of them do, but they all know of jennie brice, and some of them have see her in the theater.  "get the theater, tom," the <chief|main> say to one of the detective.  <luckily|fortunately>, what he learn over the telephone from the theater <corroborate|support> my <story|report>. jennie brice be not in the cast that week, but should have report that morning (monday) to rehearse the next week's <piece|bit>. no message have be receive from her, and a substitute <have|make> be put in her <place|station>.  the chief hang up the receiver and turn to me. "you be sure about the clock, mr. pitman?" he ask. "it be there when they move up-stair to the room?"  "yes, sir."  "you be certain you <will|leave> not find it on the parlor mantel when the water go down?"  "the mantel be uncover now. it be not there."  "you think ladley have go for good?"  "yes, sir."  "he'd be a fool to try to run away, unless--grave, you'd better get hold of the fellow, and <keep|save> him until either the woman be find or a body. the river be fall. in a couple of day we will know if she be around the premise anywhere."  before i leave, i <describe|identify> jennie brice for them carefully. <ask|expect> what she <probably|plausibly> wear, if she have go away a her husband say, i have no idea; she <have|make> a lot of clothe, and dress a good <bite|bit>. but i recall that i <have|get> see, lie on the bed, the black and white dress with the red <collar|pinch>, and they take that down, a well a the brown valise.  the chief rise and open the door for me himself. "if she actually leave <town|township> at the <time|clip> you mention," he say, "she ought not to be <hard|severe> to find. there be not many <train|trail> before seven in the morning, and most of them be local."  "and--and if she do not, if he--do you think she be in the house--or--or--the cellar?"  "not unless ladley be more of a <fool|dupe> than i think he be," he say, smile. "personally, i believe she have go away, a he say she do. but if she hasn't--he probably take the body with him when he say he be get medicine, and drop it in the current somewhere. but we must go slow with all this. there's no <use|exercise> shout 'wolf' yet."  "but--the towel?"  "he may have cut himself, shave. it _has_ be do."  "and the knife?"  he shrug his shoulder <good|safe>-naturedly.  "i've <see|realize> a perfectly good knife spoil open a bottle of pickle."  "but the slipper? and the clock?"  "my <good|effective> woman, enough shoe and slipper be forget in the bottom of cupboard year after year in flood-time, and be find float around the street, to make all the old-clothesmen in town happy. i have see almost everything float about, during one of these annual flood."  "i dare say you never saw an onyx clock <float|swim> around," i reply a little sharply. i have no sense of humor that day. he stop smile at once, and stand tug at his mustache.  "no," he admit. "an onyx clock sink, that's true. that's a very nice little point, that onyx clock. he may be try to sell it, or perhaps--" he do not finish.  i go back immediately, only stop at the market to <get|develop> meat for mr. reynolds' supper. it <be|follow> after half past five and dusk be come on. i get a boat and be row directly home. peter be not at the foot of the step. i pay the <boatman|waterman> and let him go, and <turn|go> to go up the stair. some one be speak in the hall above.  i have read somewhere that no two voice be <exactly|precisely> alike, just a no two violin ever produce precisely the same sound. i think it be what they call the timbre that be different. i have, for instance, never hear a voice like mr. pitman's, although mr. harry lauder's in a phonograph resemble it. and voice have <always|forever> do for me what odor do for some people, revive forget scene and old <memory|store>. but the memory that the voice at the head of the stair bring back be not very old, although i <have|get> forget it. i <seem|appear> to hear again, all at once, the <lap|wash> of the water sunday morning a it begin to come in over the door-sill; the sound of terry rip up the parlor carpet, and mr. ladley call me a she-devil in the next room, in reply to this <very|real> voice.  but when i get to the top of the stair, it be only mr. howell, who have <bring|add> his visitor to the flood district, and on get her <splash|slop> with the muddy water, have take her to my house for a towel and a cake of soap.  i light the lamp in the <hall|mansion>, and mr. howell introduce the girl. she be a pretty girl, slim and young, and she have take her wet good-naturedly.  "i know we be intruder, mr. <pitman|coal_miner>," she say, hold out her <hand|deal>. "especially <now|directly>, when you be in trouble."  "i have tell miss harvey a little," mr. howell say, "and i promise to show her peter, but he be not here."  <i|single> think i have <know|recognize> it be my sister's child from the moment i light the lamp. there be something of alma in her, not alma's hardness or haughtiness, but alma's dark blue eye with black lash, and alma's nose. alma be always the beauty of the family. what with the day's excitement, and see alma's child like this, in my house, i felt thing go <round|attack> and <clutch|clasp> at the <stair|step>-<rail|track>. mr. howell <catch|see> me.  "why, mr. pitman!" he say. "what's the matter?"  i get myself in hand in a moment and <smile|grin> at the girl.  "<nothing|cipher> at all," i say. "<indigestion|upset_stomach>, <most|almost> <likely|probably>. too much tea the last day or two, and not enough <solid|strong> food. i've be too anxious to eat."  lida--for she <be|follow> that to me at <once|formerly>, although i have never <see|realize> her before--lida be all sympathy and sweetness. she actually ask me to go with her to a restaurant and <have|let> a real dinner. i could imagine alma, have she know! but i excuse myself.  "i have to cook something for mr. reynolds," i say, "and i'm better <now|directly>, anyhow, thank you. mr. howell, may i speak to you for a <moment|minute>?"  he follow me along the back <hall|mansion>, which be dusk.  "i <have|take> remember something that i have <forget|leave>, mr. howell," i say. "on sunday morning, the ladleys have a visitor."  "yes?"  "they <have|take> very few visitor."  "i see."  "i do not see him, but--i hear his voice." mr. howell do not move, but i fancy he <draw|run> his breath in quickly. "it sound--it be not by any chance _you_?"  "i? a newspaper man, who go to bed at three a.<m|thousand>. on sunday <morning|aurora>, up and <about|nearly> at ten!"  "i didn't say what time it be," i say sharply.  but at that moment lida <call|telephone> from the front hall.  "i <think|consider> i hear peter," she say. "he be shut in somewhere, <whine|creak>."  we <go|get> forward at once. she be right. <peter|prick> be scratch at the <door|threshold> of mr. ladley's room, although i have leave the door close and peter in the hall. i let him out, and he crawl to me on three leg, whimper. mr. howell bend over him and felt the fourth.  "<poor|short> little beast!" he say. "his <leg|stage> be break!"  he make a splint for the dog, and with lida help, they put him to bed in a clothe-basket in my up-stair kitchen. it be easy to see how thing lay with mr. howell. he be all eye for her: he make excuse to touch her hand or her arm--little caress touch that make her color <heighten|compound>. and with it all, there be a <sort|screen> of hopelessness in his manner, a if he know how far the girl be out of his reach. know alma and her pride, i <know|recognize> better than they how hopeless it be.  i be not so sure about lida. i wonder if she be in <love|bed> with the boy, or only in love with love. she be very young, a i have be. god help her, if, like me, she sacrifice everything, to discover, <too|also> late, that she be only in love with love!      mr. reynolds <do|make> not come home to dinner after all. the water have <get|let> into the basement at the store, he telephone, one of the flood-gate in a sewer have leak, and they be move some of the department to an upper <floor|base>. i have expect to have him in the house that even, and now i be leave alone again.  but, a it happen, i be not alone. mr. grave, one of the city detective, come at half past six, and go carefully over the ladleys' <room|way>. i show him the towel and the slipper and the <break|reveal> knife, and where we have find the knife-blade. he be very non-committal, and leave in a half-hour, take the article with him in a newspaper.  at seven the door-bell ring. i go down a far a i could on the staircase, and i saw a boat outside the <door|threshold>, with the boatman and a woman in it. i call to them to <bring|take> the boat back along the hall, and i have a queer feel that it might be mr. ladley, and that i'd be make a fool of myself all day for nothing. but it be not mr. ladley.  "be this <number|bit> forty-two?" ask the woman, a the boat come back.  "yes."  "do mr. ladley live here?"  "yes. but he be not here now."  "be you mr. pittock?"  "<pitman|Pitman>, yes."  the boat bump against the <stair|step>, and the woman get out. she be a tall a mr. ladley, and when i saw her in the light from the upper hall, i know her instantly. it be temple hope, the lead woman from the liberty <theater|dramatic_art>.  "i would like to <talk|sing> to you, mr. pitman," she say. "where can we go?"  i lead the way back to my room, and when she have follow me in, she turn and shut the door.  "<now|immediately> then," she say without <any|whatever> preliminary, "where be jennie brice?"  "i don't know, miss hope," i answer.  we look at each other for a <minute|bit>, and each of u saw what the other suspect.  "he have kill her!" she exclaim. "she be afraid he would do it, and--he have."  "kill her and throw her into the river," i say. "that's what i think, and he'll go free at that. it seem there isn't any <murder|execution> when there isn't <any|whatever> corpse."  "nonsense! if he have do that, the river will <give|make> her up, eventually."  "the river doesn't always give them up," i retort. "not in flood-time, anyhow. or when they be find it be month later, and you can't <prove|establish> anything."  she <have|get> only a little time, be due at the theater soon, but she sit down and tell me the story she tell afterward on the stand:  she have know jennie brice for year, they have be together in the chorus a <long|tenacious> before a _nadjy_.  "she <be|follow> marry then to a fellow on the vaudeville circuit," miss <hope|trust> say. "burn have the <key|winder> around his neck."  clarke, i think it be, go into the tent, and come out again directly.  "there's no <key|name> <around|about> his neck," he say gruffly.  "it may have slip around under his back."  "it isn't there at all."  i run into the tent, where jones, <have|get> exhaust the resource of the injure man's clothe, be search among the blanket <on|along> which he lay.  there be no key.  i go out to the men again, bewilder. the dawn have come, a pink and rosy dawn that promise another stifle day. it reveal the disarray of the deck--the basin, the old mahogany amputate-case with it lock plate of bone, the stain and redden towel; and it show the brood and overcast face of the men.  "isn't it there?" i ask.  "our agreement be for me to carry the key to singleton's cabin and burn the captain's."  miss lee, by the rail, come forward slowly, and <look|see> up at me.  "isn't it possible," she say, "that, know where the key be, some one wish to get it, and so--"  she indicate the tent and burn.  i know then.  how <dull|sluggish> i have be, and stupid!  the men catch her mean, too, and we tramp heavily forward, the girl and i lead.  the door into the captain's room <be|follow> open, and the axe be go from the bunk.  the key, with the cord that <burn|tan> have wear around his neck, <be|follow> in the door, the <string|draw> <tear|rip> and pull a if it <have|make> be jerk <away|aside> from the unconscious man.  later on we verify this by find, on the back of burns's neck an abrade line two inch or so in length.  it be a strong cord--the kind a sailor pin his <faith|trust> to, and use indiscriminately to hold his trouser or his knife.  i order a rigid search of the <deck|adorn>, but the axe be go.  nor be it ever find.  it have take it bloody story many fathom <deep|thick> into the old atlantic, and <hide|fell> it, where many crime have be hide, in the ooze and slime of the sea-<bottom|tail>.  that day be memorable for more than the attack on <burn|glow>.  it mark a complete <revolution|gyration> in my idea of the earlier crime, and of the criminal.  two thing <influence|shape> my change of mental attitude.  the attack <on|along> <burn|fire> <be|follow> one.  i do not believe that turner have strength enough to fell so vigorous a man, even with the capstan bar which we find lie near by.  nor could he <have|give> jerk and break the amberline. mr. john i eliminate for the same <reason|conclude>, of course.  i could imagine her get the key by subtlety, wheedle the impressionable young sailor into compliance.  but force!  the second reason be the stronger.  singleton, the mate, have become a tractable and almost amiable prisoner.  like turner, he be ugly only when he be drink, and there be not even enough liquor on the ella to revive poor burn. he spend his day devise, with bit of wire, a <ring|call> <puzzle|bewilder> that he intend should make his fortune.  and i believe he contrive, <finally|eventually>, a clever enough bite of foolery.  he be anxious to <talk|sing>, and complain bitterly of loneliness, <use|practice> every <excuse|apology> to hold tom, the cook, when he <carry|run> him his meal.  he have <ask|expect> for a bible, too, and read it now and then.  the morning of burns's injury, i <visit|see> singleton.  the new outrage, <come|follow> at a <time|clock> when they be slowly recover confidence, have turn the <men|gentleman> surly.  the <loss|exit> of the axe, the <handle|treat> of which i have tell them would, under <skillful|good> eye, reveal the murderer a accurately a a photograph, be a serious blow. again arise the specter of the innocent suffer for the guilty. they go doggedly <about|around> their work, and wherever they gather there <be|follow> mutter talk of the white figure.  there be grumble, too, over their lack of weapon for defense.  the cook be a ringleader of the malcontent.  certain utensil be allow him; but he be compel at night to lock them in the <galley|cookhouse>, after either burns's inspection or mine, and to turn over the key to one of u.  on the morning after the attack, therefore, tom, <carry|expect> singleton's breakfast to him, tell him at length what have occur in the <night|dark>, and dilate on his <lack|miss> of self-defense should an attack be direct toward him.  singleton promptly offer to make him, out of wire, a key to the galley door, so that he could get what he want from it.  the cook be to <take|have> an impression of the lock.  in exchange, tom be to fetch him, from a hide place which singleton <designate|indicate> in the forward <house|sign>, a bottle of whiskey.  the cook <be|follow> a <shrewd|sharp> mulatto, and he let singleton make the <key|name>. it be after ten that morning when he bring it to me.  i be try to get the detail of his injury from burn, at the time, in the tent.  "i didn't <see|image> or hear anything, leslie,"  burn say feebly.  "i don't even remember be hit.  i felt there be some one behind me. that be all."  "there <have|take> be <nothing|zero> <suspicious|wary> earlier in the night?"  he <lay|repose> think.  he be still somewhat confuse.  "no--i <think|believe> not.  or--yes, i think once <i|single> saw some one stand by the mainmast--behind it.  it wasn't."  "how long be mr. john on deck?"  "not long."  "do she ask you to do something for her?"  pale a he be, he color; but he eye me honestly.  "yes.  don't ask me any more, leslie.  it have nothing to do with this."  "what <do|come> she ask you to do?" i persist remorselessly.  "i don't want to talk; my head ache."  "very well.  then i'll tell you what happen after i go off <watch|sentinel>. no, i wasn't spy.  i know the woman, that's all.  she say you look tire, and wouldn't it be all right if you sit down for a moment and talk to her."  "no; she say she be nervous."  "the same thing--<only|just> better.  then she persist in talk of the crime, and finally she say she would like to see the axe.  it wouldn't do any harm.  she, wouldn't touch it."  he watch me uneasily.  "she didn't either," he say.  "i'll swear to that, leslie.  she didn't go <near|about> the bunk.  she cover her face with her hand, and lean against the door.  i think she be go to faint."  "against the door, of course!  and get an impression of the <key|describe>. the door open in.  she could take out the key, press it against a <cake|coat> of wax or even a cake of soap in her hand, and slip it back into the lock again while you--what be you do while she be do all that?"  "she drop her salt.  i pick them up."  "exactly!  well, the axe be go."  he start up on his elbow.  "go!"  "throw overboard, probably.  it be not in the cabin."  it be brutal, perhaps; but the situation <be|follow> all of that.  a burn fell back, colorless, tom, the cook, bring into the tent the wire key that singleton have make.  that morning i <take|acquire> from inside of singleton's mattress a bunch of key, a long <steel|brand> <file|charge>, and the leg of one of his chair, carefully unscrew and <wrap|wind> at the end with wire a formidable club.  one of the key open singleton's door.  that be on saturday.  early monday morning we sight land.      we pick up a pilot outside the lewes breakwater a man of few word. i tell him only the outline of our story, and i believe he half discredit me at first.  god know, i be not a creditable object. when i take him aft and <show|establish> him the jolly-boat, he realize, at last, that he be face to face with a great tragedy, and pay it the tribute of throw away his cigar.  he suggest our <raise|grow> the yellow plague flag; and this we do, with a ready response from the quarantine <officer|policeman>.  the quarantine officer <come|do> out in a <power|force>-boat, and mount the ladder; and from that moment my command of the ella cease.  turner, immaculately dress, pale, distinguish, member of the yacht club and partner in the turner <line|strain>, meet him at the rail, and conduct him, with a sort of chasten affability, to the cabin.  exhaust from lack of sleep, terrify with what have go by and what be yet to come, unshaven and unkempt, the men gather <on|along> the forecastle-head and wait.  the conference below <last|lowest> perhaps an hour.  at the end of that <time|clock> the quarantine officer come up and shout a <direction|guidance> from below, a a result of which the jolly-boat be cut loose, and, tow by the <tug|labour>, take to the quarantine station.  there be an argument, i believe, between turner and the officer, a to allow u to <proceed|go> up the river without wait for the police.  turner prevail, however, and, from the <time|clock> we hoist the yellow flag, we be on our <way|manner> to the city, a tug <pant|puff> beside u, urge the broad and comfortable line of the <old|older> cargo boat to a <semblance|colour> of speed.  the quarantine officer, a dapper little man, remain on the boat, and busy himself officiously, get the <name|figure> of the men, peer at singleton through his bar window, and express disappointment at my lack of foresight in have the bloodstain clear away.  "every stain be a clue, my man, to the <train|rail> eye," he chirrup. "with an axe, <too|likewise>!  what a brutal method!  brutal!  where be the axe?"  "go," i say patiently.  "it be steal out of the captain's cabin."  he eye me over his glass.  "that's very strange," he comment.  "no stain, no axe!  you fellow have be mighty careful to destroy the evidence, haven't you?"  all that long day we make our deliberate <progress|advance> up the river. the <luggage|baggage> from the after house be carry up on <deck|decorate> by adam and clarke, and stand wait for the customhouse.  turner, his hand behind him, pace the deck hour by hour, his <heavy|hard> face colorless.  his wife, dark, repress, with a look of be always on guard, <watch|sentinel> him <furtively|on_the_sly>.  mr. john, dress in black, <talk|utter> to the doctor; and, from the note he make, i know she be tell the <story|level> of the <tragedy|catastrophe>.  and here, there, and everywhere, efficient, normal, and <so|therefore> lovely that it hurt me to look at her, be elsa. williams, the butler, have emerge from his chrysalis of <fright|fear>, and be ostentatiously look after the family's comfort.  no clearer indication could have be give of the new status of affair than his change attitude toward me.  he come up to me, early in the afternoon, and demand that i wash down the deck before the woman come up.  i smile down at him cheerfully.  "williams," i say, "you be a coward--a <mean|average>, white-livered coward. you have skulk in the after <house|home>, behind woman, when there be man's work to do.  if i wash that <deck|floor>, it will be with you a a mop."  he bluster something about speak to mr. turner and see that i do the work i be <bring|get> <on|along> board to <do|come>, and, see turner's <eye|heart> on u, finish his speech with an ugly epithet.  my nerve be strain to the utmost: lack of sleep and food have do their work. i be no <longer|long> in <command|bid> of the ella; i be a <common|green> sailor, ready to vent my spleen through my fist.  i knock him down with my open hand.  it be a barbarous and a reckless <thing|matter> to do.  he pick himself up and limp away, mutter.  turner have watch the <scene|prospect> with his cold <blue|sorry> eye, and the little doctor with his near-sight one.  "a dangerous man, that!" say the doctor.  "<dangerous|severe> and intelligent," reply turner.  "a bad combination!"  it be late that night when the ella anchor in the river at philadelphia.  we be not allow to land.  the police take charge of ship, crew, and <passenger|rider>.  the men sleep heavily on deck, except burn, who develop a slight fever from his injury, and <move|run> about restlessly.  it seem to me that the vigilance of the officer be exert largely to prevent an <escape|flight> from the vessel, and not sufficiently for the safety of those on board.  i speak of this, and a guard be place at the companionway again.  thus i saw elsa lee for the last time until the trial.  she be dress, a she have be in the afternoon, in a dark cloth suit of some sort, and i do not see her until i have speak to the officer in <charge|file>.  she turn, at my voice, and call me to join her where she stand.  "we <be|follow> back again, leslie."  "yes, miss lee."  "back to--what?  to <live|be> the whole thing over again in a courtroom! if only we could go away, anywhere, and try to <forget|leave>!"  she have not expect any answer, and i have none ready.  i be think--heaven help me--that there be thing i would not forget if i could: the lift of her <lash|strap> a she look, up at me; the few word we have have together, the day she have tell me the deck be not clean; the night i have touch her hand with my lip.  "we be to be release, <i|single> believe," she say, "on our own--some legal term; i forget it."  "<recognizance|recognisance>, probably."  "yes.  you do not <know|recognize> law a well a medicine?"  "i be sorry--no; and i know very little medicine."  "but you sew up a wind!"  "a a matter of fact," i admit, "that <be|follow> my initial performance, and it be badly do.  it--it pucker."  she turn on me a trifle impatiently.  "why <do|come> you make such a secret of your identity?" she demand. "be it a pose? or--<have|get> you a reason for conceal it?"  "it be not a pose; and i have nothing to be ashamed of, unless poverty--"  "of course not.  what do you mean by poverty?"  "the common garden variety <sort|class>.  i have hardly a dollar in the world. a to my <identity|individuality>,--if it interest you at all, i graduate in medicine last june.  i spend the last of the money that be to educate me in purchase a dress suit to graduate in, and a supper by <way|manner> of celebration.  the dress suit help me to my <diploma|sheepskin>.  the supper give me typhoid."  "so that be it!"  "not jail, you see."  "and what be you <go|run> to do now?"  i glance around to where a police officer stand behind u watchfully.  "now?  why, now i go to jail in earnest."  "you <have|take> be very good to u," she say wistfully.  "we have all be strain and nervous.  maybe you <have|get> not think i notice or--or appreciate what you be do; but i have, always.  you <have|get> give all of yourself for u.  you have not sleep or eat.  and now you be go to be imprison.  it isn't <just|only>!"  i try to speak lightly, to reassure her.  "don't be unhappy about that," i say.  "a nice, safe jail, where one may sleep and eat, and eat and sleep--oh, i shall be very <comfortable|easy>! and if you wish to make me exceedingly happy, you <will|leave> see that they let me <have|let> a razor."  but, to my surprise, she bury her face in her arm.  i could not believe at <first|low> that she be cry.  the policeman have wander across to the other rail, and stand look out at the city light, his back to u.  i put my hand out to touch her soft hair, <then|so> draw it back.  i could not take advantage of her sympathy, of the hysterical excitement of that last night on the ella.  i put my hand in my pocket, and hold them there, clench, lest, in spite of my will, i reach out to <take|get> her in my arm.      and now i come, with some hesitation, to the trial.  hesitation, because i rely on mcwhirter to keep a record.  and mcwhirter, from his note, appear to have be <carry|run> away at time by excitement, and either jot down row of unintelligible word, or wait until <even|yet> and make up his note, like a woman's expense account, from a memory never noticeable for accuracy.  at dawn, the morning after we anchor, charlie jones rouse me, grin.  "friend of yours over the rail, leslie," he say.  "want to take you ashore!"  i know no one in philadelphia except the <chap|fellow> who have take me yacht once, and i felt <pretty|fairly> certain that he would not associate leslie the football player with leslie the sailor on the ella.  i go reluctantly to the rail, and look down.  below me, <just|precisely> visible in the river mist of the early morning, be a small boat from which two men be look up.  one be mcwhirter!  "hello, old top," he cry.   "or <be|follow> it you behind that beard?"  "it's i, all right, mac," i say, somewhat huskily.  what with see him again, his kindly <face|front> behind it glass, the cheerful <faith|trust> in me which be his contribution to our friendship,--even the way he shake his own hand in <default|default_option> of mine,--my throat tighten.  here, after all, be home and a friend.  he look up at the <rail|train>, and motion to a rope that hang there.  "get your <stuff|thrust> and come with u for breakfast," he say.  "you <look|appear> a if you hadn't eat since you leave."  "i'm afraid i can't, mac."  "they're not go to <hold|give> you, be they?"  "for a day or so, yes."  mac's reply to this be a violent <resume|survey> of the ancestry and present lose condition of the philadelphia police, end with a request that i jump over, and let them go to the place he have just designate a their abide-<place|spot> in eternity.  on an officer lounge to the rail and look down, however, he subside into a low mutter.  the story of how mcwhirter happen to be float on the bosom of the <delaware|DE> river before five o'clock in the morning be a long one--it be month before i get it in full.  briefly, go home from the theater in new york the night before, he have buy an "extra" which have contain a brief account of the ella's return.  he <seem|appear> to have go into a frenzy of excitement at once.  he borrow a small car,--one <scornfully|disdainfully> designate a a "road louse,"--and assemble in it, in wild confusion, one suit of clothe for me, his own and much too small, one hypodermic case, an armful of newspaper with red scare-head, a bottle of brandy, a bottle of digitalis, one police card, and one excite young lawyer, of the same vintage in law that mac and i be in medicine.  at the <last|final> moment, fearful that the <police|law> might not know who i be, he have fling in a scrapbook in which he <have|make> paste--with a glue that be to make his fortune--record of my exploit on the football field!  a dozen mile from philadelphia the little machine have turn over on a <curve|arch>, knock all the law and most of the enthusiasm out of walter, the legal gentleman, and smash the brandy-bottle. mcwhirter have pick himself up, kick <viciously|brutally> at the car, and, gather up his impedimenta, have make the rest of the journey by <foot|pick> and street-car.  his wrath at find me a prisoner be unbounded; his scorn at <walter|Bruno_Walter>, the attorney, for not confound the <police|constabulary> with law enough to free me, <be|follow> furious and contemptuous.  he pick up the oar in sullen <silence|secrecy>, and, lean on them, call a loud and defiant farewell for the benefit of the officer.  "<all|completely> <right|rectify>," he say.  "an hour or so won't make much <difference|departure>. but you'll <be|follow> free today, all <right|correctly>, all right.  and don't let them bluff you, boy.  if the police get <funny|comic>, tackle them and throw 'em overboard, one by one.  you can do it."  he make an insult gesture at the police, pick up his oar, and row away into the mist.  but i be not free, that day, nor for many day.  a i have expect, turner, his family, mr. john, and the <stewardess|air_hostess> be release, after examination.  the rest of u be take to jail.  singleton a a suspect, the others to make sure of their presence at the trial.  the <murder|dispatch> take <place|site> on the morning of august 12.  the <grand|fantastic> jury meet late in september, and find an indictment against singleton. the trial begin on the 16th of november.  the confinement be terrible.  accustom to regular exercise a i be, i suffer mentally and physically. i have take dinner at bellwood before, and the memory be not hilarious. miss letitia <be|follow> deaf, but choose to ignore the fact. with superb indifference she would <break|go> into the conversation with some wholly alien remark that necessitate a reassemble of one's idea, make the meal a series of mental gymnastics. miss jane, through long practice, and because she only skim the surface of conversation, take her cerebral flight easily, but i be more unwieldy of mind.  nor be miss letitia's dominance wholly conversational. her sister jane be her creature, alternately snub and bully. to miss letitia, jane, in <spite|malice> of her sixty-five year, be still a child, and sometimes a bad one. indeed, many a child of ten <be|follow> more sophisticate. miss letitia give her expurgate book to read, and forbid her to read divorce court proceed in the newspaper. once, a recreant housemaid present the establishment with a healthy male infant, jane be send to the <country|area> for a month, and <be|follow> only bring back when the house have be fumigate throughout.  poor miss jane! she meet me with <flutter|dart> cordiality in the hall that night, safe in be herself for <once|formerly>, with the knowledge that miss letitia always receive me from a throne-like horsehair sofa in the <back|backward> parlor. she wear a <new|fresh> lace cap, and be twitteringly excite.  "our niece be here," she explain, a i take off my coat--everything be "ours" with jane; "mine" with letitia--"and we be have an ice at dinner. please say that ice be not injurious, mr. knox. my sister be so oppose to them and i <have|give> to beg for this."  "<on|along> the contrary, the doctor have order ice for my young nephew," i say gravely, "and i dote on them myself."  miss jane <beam|send>. indeed, there be something almost unnaturally gay about the little old lady all that even. <perhaps|maybe> it be the new lace cap. later, <i|single> try to analyze her manner, to recall exactly what she have say, to remember anything that could possibly help. but i could find no clue to what follow.  miss letitia receive me a usual, in the back parlor. miss fleming be there also, sew by a window, and in her straight white dress with her hair draw back and braid around her head, she look even younger than before. there be no <time|clock> for conversation. miss letitia launch at once into the extravagance of both molasses and butter on the color orphans' bread and after a <glance|glint> at me, and a quick comprehension from my face that i have no news for her, the girl at the window bend over her sew again.  "molasses breed worm," miss letitia say decisively. "so do pork. and <yet|still> those child think heaven mean ham and molasses three time a day."  "you have have no news at all?" miss fleming say cautiously, her head <bend|turn> over her <work|cultivate>.  "none," i return, under cover of the table linen to which miss letitia's mind have veer. "i have a <good|respectable> man work on it." a she glance at me questioningly, "it need a detective, miss fleming." evidently another day without news have lessen her distrust of the police, for she nod acquiescence and go on with her sew. <miss|lack> letitia's monotonous monologue go on, and i <give|leave> it such attention a i might. for the lamp have be light, and with every movement of the girl across, i could see the gleam of a diamond on her engagement finger.  "if i didn't watch her, jane would ruin them," say miss letitia. "she give 'em apple when they keep their face <clean|blank>, and the bill for soap have go up double. soap once a day's <enough|plenty> for a color child. do you smell anything burn, knox?"  i sniff and lie, whereupon miss letitia sweep her black silk, her color orphan and her <majestic|olympian> presence out of the room. a the <door|doorway> close, miss fleming put down her sew and rise. for the first time i saw how weary she look.  "i do not dare to tell them, mr. knox," she say. "they be old, and they hate him anyhow. <i|single> couldn't sleep last night. <suppose|say> he should have <go|get> back, and find the house close!"  "he would telephone here at once, wouldn't he?" i suggest.  "i suppose so, yes." she take up her <sew|sew_together> from the chair with a sigh. "but i'm afraid he won't come--not soon. i <have|let> hem tea towel for aunt letitia to-day until i be frantic, and all <day|daytime> i <have|make> be wonder over something you say yesterday. you say, you remember, that you <be|follow> not a detective, that some men could take nineteen from thirty-five and leave nothing. what do you mean?"  i be speechless for a moment.  "the fact be--i--you <see|consider>," i blunder, "it be a--merely a figure of <speech|lecture>, a--speech of figure be more accurate,--" and then dinner be announce and i be save. but although she say little or nothing during the meal, i catch her look across at me <once|formerly> or twice in a bewilder, <puzzle|baffle> fashion. i could fairly see her revolve my detestable <figure|project> in her <mind|thinker>.  miss letitia preside over the table in garrulous majesty. the two old lady <pick|blame> at their food, and miss jane have a spot of pink in each wither cheek. margery fleming make a brave pretense, but leave her plate almost untouched. a for me, i eat a substantial masculine meal and half <apologize|justify> for my appetite, but letitia do not hear. she tear the board of manager to shred with the roast, and denounce them with the salad. but jane be all anxious hospitality.  "please _do_ eat your dinner," she whisper. "i make the salad myself. and i know what it take to keep a <big|liberal> man <go|fling>. harry eat more than letitia and i together. doesn't he, margery?"  "harry?" i ask.  "mr. stevens be an unmitigated <fool|shoot>. i say if they elect her president i'd not leave a penny to the <home|family>. that's why i send for you, knox." and to the maid, "tell heppie to wash those cup in luke-warm water. they're the best one. and not to drink her coffee out of them. she let her teeth slip and bite a piece out of one the last time."  miss jane lean forward to me after a smile glance at her niece across.  "harry wardrop, a cousin's son, and--" she pat margery's hand with it ring--"soon to be something closer."  the girl's face color, but she <return|homecoming> miss jane's gentle pressure.  "they put up an iron fence," miss letitia revert somberly to her grievance, "when a wooden one would have do. it be extravagance, <ruinous|catastrophic> extravagance."  "harry stay with u when he be in manchester," <miss|escape> jane go on, nod brightly across at letitia a if she, too, be damn the executive board. "lately, he have be almost all the time in plattsburg. he be secretary to margery's father. it be a position of considerable responsibility, and we be very proud of him."  i have expect something of the sort, but the <remainder|difference> of the meal have somehow lose it savor. there be a <lull|calm> in the conversation while dessert be be bring in. miss jane sit quiver, watch her sister's face for sign of trouble; the latter have <subside|settle> into mutter grumble, and miss fleming sit, one hand on the table, star <absently|inattentively> at her engagement ring.  "you <look|expect> like a fool in that cap, jane," volunteer letitia, while the plat be be <bring|get> in. "what's for dessert?"  "ice-<cream|skim>," <call|anticipate> miss jane, over the table.  "well, you needn't," snap letitia, "i can hear you well enough. you tell me it be junket."  "i say ice-cream, and you say it would be all right," poor jane shriek. "if you drink a cup of hot water after it, it won't hurt you."  "fiddle," letitia snap unpleasantly. "i'm not go to freeze my <stomach|brook> and <then|so> <thaw|warming> it out like a drain pipe. <tell|say> heppie to put my ice-cream on the stave."  so we wait until miss letitia's have be heat, and be bring in, sicklied over with pale hue, not of think, but of confectioners' dye. miss letitia eat it resignedly. "like a not i'll break out, i do the last time," she say gloomily. "i only hope i don't break out in color."  the meal be over <finally|eventually>, but if i have hop for another word alone with margery fleming that even, i be foredoom to disappointment. letitia send the girl, not ungently, to bed, and order jane out of the room with a single curt gesture toward the <door|threshold>.  "you'd better wash those cup yourself, jane," she say. "i don't see <any|whatever> sense anyhow in get out the best china unless there's <real|tangible> company. besides, i'm go to talk business."  poor, meek, spiritless miss jane! the situation be absurd in spite of it pathos. she confide to me once that never in her sixty-five year of life have she buy herself a gown, or choose the dinner. she be snub with painstaking perseverance, and send out of the <room|way> when subject require <frank|outspoken> handle be under discussion. she be a unsophisticated a a <child|youngster> of ten, a unworldly a a baby, a--<well|easily>, <poor|miserable> miss jane, again.  when the door have <close|closely> behind her, miss letitia listen for a moment, get up suddenly and cross the <room|way> with amaze swiftness for her year, pounce on the <knob|boss> and throw it open again. but the passage be empty; miss jane's slim little figure be disappear into the kitchen. the older sister watch her out of <sight|lot>, and then return to her sofa without deign explanation.  "i didn't want to see you about the will, mr. knox," she begin without prelude. "the will can wait. i ain't go to die just yet--not if i know anything. but although i think you'd look a heap better and more responsible if you wear some hair on your face, still in most thing i think you're a man of sense. and you're not too young. that's why i didn't send for <harry|beset> wardrop; he's too young."  i wince at that. miss letitia lean <forward|fore> and put her bony hand on my knee.  "i've <be|follow> rob," she announce in a half whisper, and straighten to watch the effect of her word.  "indeed!" i say, properly thunderstruck. i _was_ surprise. i have <always|forever> believe that <only|alone> the use of the fourth dimension in space would enable any one, not desire, to gain access to the <maitland|Frederic_William_Maitland> <house|household>. "of money?"  "not money, although i have a <good|effective> bite in the house." this also i know. it be say of miss letitia that when money <come|do> into her possession it go out of circulation.  "not--the pearl?" i ask.  she answer my question with another.  "when you have those pearl appraise for me at the jeweler last year, how many be there?"  "not quite one hundred. <i|single> think--yes, ninety-eight."  "exactly," she corroborate, in <triumph|rejoice>. "they <belong|go> to my mother. margery's mother get some of them. that's a good many year ago, young man. they be worth more than they be then--a great deal more."  "twenty-two thousand dollar," i repeat. "you remember, miss letitia, that <i|single> protest vigorously at the <time|sentence> against your keep them in the house."  miss letitia ignore this, but before she <go|get> on she repeat again her cat-like pounce at the door, <only|merely> to find the hall empty a before. this time when she sit down it be knee to knee with me.  "yesterday morning," she say gravely, "i get down the box; they have always be keep in the <small|little> <safe|rubber> in the top of my closet. when jane find a picture of my niece, margery fleming, in harry's room, i think it likely there be some truth in the gossip jane hear about the two, and--if there be go to <be|follow> a wed--why, the pearl be to <go|get> to margery anyhow. but--i find the door of the safe unlock and a little bite open--and <ten|tenner> of the pearl <be|follow> go!"  "go!" i echo. "ten of them! why, it's ridiculous! if ten, why not the whole ninety-eight?"  "how do i know?" she reply with asperity. "that's what i <keep|save> a lawyer for: that's why i send for you."  for the second time in two day i protest the same thing.  "but you need a detective," i cry. "if you can <find|obtain> the thief i will be <glad|happy> to send him where he ought to be, but i couldn't find him."  "i will not have the police," she persist inflexibly. "they will come around ask <impertinent|immaterial> question, and tell the newspaper that a foolish old <woman|char> have <get|let> what she deserve."  "then you be go to send them to a bank?"  "you have le sense than i think," she snap. "i be go to <leave|will> them where they be, and <watch|follow>. whoever take the ten will be back for more, mark my word."  "i don't advise it," i say decidedly. "you have most of them now, and you might easily lose them all; not only that, but it be not safe for you or your sister."  "stuff and nonsense!" the old lady say, with spirit. "a for jane, she doesn't <even|still> know they be go. i know who do it. it be the new housemaid, bella mackenzie. nobody else could get in. i lock up the house myself at night, and i'm in the habit of do a pretty thorough job of it. they <go|run> in the last three week, for i <count|consider> them saturday three week ago myself. the only person in the house in that time, except ourselves, be harry, bella and hepsibah, who's be here for forty year and wouldn't know a pearl from a pickle <onion|onion_plant>."  "then--what do you want me to do?" i ask. "have bella arrest and her trunk search?"  i felt myself shrink in the old lady's esteem every minute.  "her trunk!" she say scornfully. "i turn it inside out this morning, pretend i think she be steal the laundry <soap|max>. like a not she have them bury in the vegetable garden. what i want you to <do|come> be to stay here for three or four <night|dark>, to be on hand. when i catch the thief, i want my lawyer right by."  it end by my consent, of course. miss letitia be seldom refuse. i telephone to fred that i would not be home, listen for voice and decide margery fleming have go to <bed|know>. miss jane light me to the door of the guest room, and saw that everything be comfortable. her thin gray curl bob a she examine the water pitcher, saw to the towel, and felt the bed linen for dampness. at the <door|threshold> she stop and turn around timidly.  "have--have anything happen to disturb my sister?" she ask. "she--have be almost <irritable|excitable> all day."  almost!  "she be worry about her color orphan," i evade. "she do not approve of firework for them on the fourth of july."  miss jane <be|follow> satisfy. i watch her little, <old|older>, black-rob figure go lightly down the hall. then i bolt the door, open all the window, and proceed to a <surreptitious|furtive> <smoke|pot>.      the window <be|follow> wide open, it be not long before a great moth <come|total> <whir|whirr> in. he hurl himself at the light and then, dazzle and sing, begin to beat with noisy thump against the barrier of the ceiling. find no <egress|egression> there, he be back at the lamp again, whirl in dizzy circle until at last, wear out, he drop to the <table|postpone>, where he lay on his back, kick impotently.  the room begin to fill with tiny wing creature that fling themselves headlong to destruction, so i put out the light and sit down near the window, with my cigar and my thought.  miss letitia's trouble i <dismiss|can> shortly. while it be odd that only ten pearl should have be take, still--in every other way it bore the <mark|scar> of an ordinary theft. the thief might have <think|believe> that by <leave|will> the majority of the gem he could postpone discovery indefinitely. but the fleming case be of a different order. take by itself, fleming's disappearance could have be easily account for. there must <be|follow> time in the live of all unscrupulous individual when they feel the need of retire temporarily from the public eye. but the intrusion into the fleming home, the <ransack|plunder> desk and the break money drawer--most of all, the bite of paper with eleven twenty-two on it--here be a hurdle my legal mind <refuse|resist> to take.  i have <finish|last> my second cigar, and be grow more and more wakeful, when i <hear|see> a footstep on the path <around|about> the house. it be black outside; when i look out, a i do <cautiously|carefully>, i could not see even the gray-white of the cement walk. the step have cease, but there be a sound of fumble at one of the shutter below. the catch click twice, a if some thin instrument be be slip underneath to raise it, and once i catch a mutter exclamation.  i draw in my head and, puff my cigar until it be glow, manage by it light to see that it be a quarter to two. when i listen again, the <house|mansion>-breaker have move to another window, and be shake it cautiously.  with miss letitia's story of the pearl fresh in my <mind|listen>, i felt at once that the thief, find his ten a prize, have come back for more. my first impulse <be|follow> to go to the head of my bed, where i <be|follow> accustom to keep a revolver. with the <touch|ghost> of the tall corner post, however, <i|single> remember that i be not at home, and that it be not likely there be a weapon in the house.  finally, after knock over an <ornament|grace> that shatter <on|along> the hearth and sound like the crash of <doom|fate>, i find on the mantel a heavy brass candlestick, and with it in my hand i step into the gloom of the hallway and <felt|find> my way to the stair.  there be no <night|dark> light; the darkness be total. i <find|see> the stair before <i|single> expect to, and come within an ace of pitch down, headlong. i <have|make> kick off my shoe--a fact which i regret later. once down the stair i be on more familiar territory. i go at once into the library, which be beneath my room, but the sound at the window have cease. i think <i|single> hear step on the walk, go toward the front of the house. i wheel <quickly|speedily> and start for the door, when something <strike|take> me a terrific blow on the nose. i reel back and sit down, dizzy and shock. it be <only|alone> when no second blow follow the first that i <realize|see> what have occur.  with my two hand out before me in the blackness, i have grope, one hand on either side of the open door, which of course i have strike violently with my nose. afterward i find it have bleed considerably, and my collar and tie must have add to my ghastly appearance.  my candlestick have roll under the table, and after crawl <around|roughly> <on|along> my hand and knee, i find it. i have lose, i suppose, three or four minute, and i be <rag|shred> at my awkwardness and stupidity. no one, however, seem to have hear the noise. for all her boast watchfulness, miss letitia must have be asleep. i get back into the hall and from there to the din-room. some one be fumble at the shutter there, and a <i|single> look they swing open. it <be|follow> so dark outside, with the tree and the distance from the street, that only the creak of the shutter <tell|say> it have open. i stand in the middle of the room, with one hand firmly clutch my candlestick.  but the window refuse to move. the burglar seem to have no proper tool; he <get|go> something under the sash, but it snap, and through the heavy plate-glass i could hear him swear. then he abruptly leave the window and make for the front of the house.  i blunder in the same direction, my unshod <foot|hoof> strike on project furniture and cause me agony, even through my excitement. when i reach the front door, however, i be amaze to find it unlock, and stand open <perhaps|possibly> an inch. i stop uncertainly. <i|single> be in a peculiar <position|attitude>; not even the most ardent admirer of antique <brass|cheek> candlestick indorse them a weapon of offense or defense. but, there seem to be nothing else to do, i open the door quietly and step out into the darkness. slowly, too--it be a <new|fresh> business for me--<i|single> be form a <theory|hypothesis> of my own. it be a <strange|unusual> one, but it <seem|appear> to fit the fact a i know them. with the story wardrop tell that afternoon come my first glimmer of light.  he be look <better|good> than he <have|let> when i saw him before, but the news of mr. butler's approach death and the manner of her injury affect him strangely. he <have|let> see the paper, like bella, and he turn <on|along> me almost fiercely when i enter the library. margery be in her old position at the window, look out, and i know the despondent droop of her shoulder.  "be she conscious?" wardrop ask eagerly, indicate the article in the paper.  "no, not now--at least, it be not likely."  he look relieve at that, but only for a moment. then he begin to pace the room nervously, evidently debate some move. his next action show the development of a resolution, for he push forward two chair for margery and myself.  "sit down, both of you," he direct. "i've get a lot to say, and i want you both to listen. when margery have <hear|see> the whole story, she will probably despise me for the rest of her life. i can't help it. i've get to tell all i know, and it isn't so much after all. you didn't fool me yesterday, knox; i know what that doctor be after. but he couldn't make me tell who kill mr. fleming, because, before god, i didn't know."     "i have to go back to the night <miss|escape> jane disappear--and that's another thing that have <drive|take> me desperate. will you <tell|say> me why i should be suspect of have a <hand|paw> in that, when she <have|let> be a mother to me? if she be dead, she can't exonerate me; if she <be|follow> live, and we find her, she will tell you what i tell you--that i <know|recognize> nothing of the whole terrible business."  "i be quite certain of that, wardrop," i interpose. "besides, i think i have get to the bottom of that mystery."  margery look at me quickly, but i shake my head. it be too early to tell my suspicion.  "the thing that look black against me be bad enough, but they have nothing to do with miss jane. i will have to <go|get> back to before the <night|dark> she--go away, back to the time mr. butler be the <state|submit> treasurer, and your father, margery, be his cashier.  "butler be not a business man. he <let|have> too much responsibility lie with his subordinate--and then, accord to the story, he couldn't do much anyhow, against schwartz. the <cashier|bank_clerk> be entirely under machine control, and butler be neglectful. you remember, knox, the crash, when three bank, rotten to the core, go under, and it be find a large amount of state money <have|give> <go|run> too. it <be|follow> fleming who do it--i be sorry, margery, but this be no time to mince word. it be fleming who deposit the money in the wreck bank, know what would happen. when the crash come, butler's surety, to save themselves, confiscate every dollar he have in the world. butler <go|get> to the penitentiary for six month, on some minor <count|calculate>, and when he get out, after write to fleming and schwartz, protest his innocence, and ask for enough out of the <fortune|chance> they have rob him of to support his wife, he kill himself, at the white cat."  margery be very pale, but quiet. she sit with her finger lock in her lap, and her eye on wardrop.  "it be a bad business," wardrop go on wearily. "fleming move into butler's place a treasurer, and <take|remove> lightfoot a his cashier. that <keep|save> the <lid|eyelid> on. once or <twice|double>, when there be an unexpected call for fund, the treasury be almost empty, and schwartz carry thing over himself. i go to plattsburg a mr. fleming's private secretary when he <become|go> treasurer, and from the <first|low> i know thing be even worse than the average <state|land> <government|politics>.  "schwartz and fleming have to hold together; they hat each other, and the feel be treble when fleming <marry|wed> schwartz's divorce wife."  margery look at me with startle, incredulous eye. what she must have see confirm wardrop's word, and she <lean|run> back in her chair, limp and unnerve. but she hear and comprehend every word wardrop be say.  "the <woman|char> be a very ordinary person, but it <seem|appear> schwartz care for her, and he try to stab mr. <fleming|Ian_Fleming> shortly after the <marriage|union>. about a year ago mr. fleming say another attempt have be make on his <life|biography>, with poison; he be very much alarm, and i notice a change in him from that time on. thing be not <go|fling> well at the treasury; schwartz and his crowd be make demand that be <hard|severe> to supply, and behind all that, fleming be afraid to go out alone at night.  "he <employ|apply> a man to protect him, a <man|mankind> name carter, who have be a bartender in plattsburg. when <thing|affair> begin to happen here in manchester, he take carter to the home a a butler.  "then the borough <bank|deposit> get shaky. if it <go|fling> down there would be an ugly scandal, and fleming would go too. his <note|observe> for half a million be there, without <security|protection>, and he dare not show the cancel <note|mark> he have, with schwartz's indorsement.  "i'm not proud of the <rest|remainder> of the story, margery." he stop his nervous pace and stand <look|appear> down at her. "i <be|follow> engage to marry a girl who be everything on earth to me, and--<i|single> be private secretary to the state treasurer, with the princely salary of such a <position|office>!  "mr. <fleming|Alexander_Fleming> come back here when the borough bank threaten failure, and try to <get|have> money enough to tide over the trouble. a half million would have do it, but he couldn't get it. he be in butler's position exactly, only he be guilty and butler be innocent. he raise a little money here, and i go to plattsburg with security and letter. it isn't necessary to go over the thing i suffer there; i <bring|get> back one <hundred|c> and ten thousand dollar, in a <package|bundle> in my russia leather <bag|dish>. and--i have something else."  he waver for the first time in his recital. he go on more rapidly, and without look at either of u.  "i carry, not in the valise, a bundle of letter, five in all, which have <be|follow> write by henry butler to mr. fleming, letter that show what a <dupe|gull> butler <have|take> be, that he have be negligent, but not <criminal|vicious>; accuse fleming of have ruin him, and demand certain <note|observe> that would have prove it. if butler could have <produce|get> the letter at the time of his trial, thing would have be different."  "be you go to sell the letter?" margery demand, with <quick|ready> scorn.  "i intend to, but--<i|single> didn't. it be a little bite too dirty, after all. i <meet|fulfil> mr. butler for the second time in my life, at the gate down there, a i come up from the train the night i get here from plattsburg. she have offer to buy the letter, and i have bring them to sell to her. and then, at the <last|final> minute, i lie. i say i couldn't get them--that they be lock in the monmouth avenue house. i put her in a taxicab that she <have|make> wait, and she go back to <town|township>. i felt like a cad; she want to clear her husband's memory, and i--well, mr. fleming be your father, margery, i couldn't hurt you like that."  "<do|make> you think mr. butler take your leather bag?" i <ask|expect>.  "i do not think so. it seem to be the only <explanation|account>, but i do not let it out of my hand one moment while we <be|follow> talk. my hand be cramp from hold it, when she give up in despair at last, and go back to the city."  "what do you do with the letter she want?"  "<i|single> keep them with me that night, and the next morning hide them in the secret closet. that be when i drop my fountain <pen|compose>!"  "and the pearl?" margery ask suddenly. "when do you <get|let> them, harry?"  to my surprise his face do not change. he appear to be think.  "two day before i leave," he say. "we be use every method to get money, and your father say to sacrifice them, if necessary."  "my father!"  he wheel on u both.  "<do|come> you <think|believe> i steal them?" he demand. and i confess that i be ashamed to say i have <think|believe> precisely that.  "your father <give|make> me nine unmounted pearl to sell," he reiterate. "i get about a thousand dollar for them--eleven hundred and something, i believe."  margery <look|await> at me. i think she be fairly stun. to learn that her father have marry again, that he have be the keystone in an <arch|curve> of villainy that, with him go, be now about to fall, and to associate him with so small and mean a thing a the theft of a handful of pearl--she be fairly stun.  "then," i say, to <bring|add> wardrop back to his <story|level>, "you find you have be rob of the money, and you go in to tell mr. fleming. you have some word, didn't you?"  "he think what you all think," wardrop say bitterly. "he accuse me of steal the money. i felt worse than a thief. he be desperate, and i take his revolver from him."  margery <have|give> put her <hand|reach> over her eye. it <be|follow> a terrible strain for her, but when i suggest that she <wait|expect> for the rest of the story she refuse vehemently.  "i come back here to bellwood, and the first thing i <learn|acquire> be about miss jane. when i <saw|see> the blood <print|mark> on the stair rail, i <think|consider> she be murder, and i have more than i could stand. i take the letter out of the secret closet, before i could <show|establish> it to you and hunter, and later i put them in the leather bag i give you, and lock it. you have it, haven't you, knox?"  i nod.  "a for that night at the club, i tell the truth then, but not all the truth. i suppose i be a coward, but <i|single> be afraid to. if you know schwartz, you would understand."  with the memory of his huge figure and the heavy under-shoot <face|aspect> that i have see the night before, i could understand very well, know wardrop.  "i go to that <room|way> at the white cat that night, because i be afraid not to go. fleming might kill himself or some one else. i go up the stair, slowly, and <i|single> hear no shoot. at the door i hesitate, then open it <quietly|softly>. the door into the build-in staircase be just close. it must <have|make> take me only an instant to realize what have happen. <fleming|Alexander_Fleming> be sway forward a i catch him. i jump to the staircase and <look|see> down, but i be too late. the door below have close. i know in another minute who have be there, and escape. it be rain, you remember, and schwartz have forget to <take|acquire> his umbrella with his name on the handle!"  "schwartz!"  "now do you understand why i be be follow?" he demand. "i have be under surveillance every minute since that night. there's probably some one hang around the gate now. anyhow, i be frantic. i saw how it look for me, and if i <have|give> bring schwartz into it, i would have be knife in forty-eight hour. i hardly remember what i do. i know i run for a doctor, and i <take|get> the umbrella with me and leave it in the vestibule of the <first|low> house i <saw|see> with a doctor's sign. i ring the bell like a crazy man, and then hunter come along and say to <go|get> back; doctor gray be at the club.  "that be all i <know|recognize>. i'm not proud of it, margery, but it might have be worse, and it's the truth. it clear up something, but not all. it doesn't tell where aunt jane be, or who have the hundred thousand. but it do show who kill your father. and if you know what be good for you, knox, you <will|leave> let it go at that. you can't fight the police and the court single-hand. look how the whole thing <be|follow> drop, and the most cold-blood kind of murder turn into suicide. suicide without a weapon! bah!"  "i <be|follow> not so sure about schwartz," i say thoughtfully. "we haven't yet learn about eleven twenty-two c."      miss jane maitland have be miss for ten day. in that time not one word have come from her. the reporter from the _eagle_ have locate her in a dozen place, and be grow thin and haggard follow little old lady along the street--and be send about his <business|job> tartly when he try to make inquiry.  some thing puzzle me more than ever in the <light|illuminate> of wardrop's story. for the third time i ask myself why miss letitia deny the loss of the pearl. there <be|follow> nothing in what we have learn, either, to <tell|say> why miss jane have go away--to ascribe a motive.  how she have <go|run>, in view of wardrop's story of the cab, be clear. she have go by street-<car|machine>, walk the three mile to wynton alone at two o'clock in the morning, although she <have|make> never stir around the house at night without a <candle|taper>, and be privately know to sleep with a light when miss letitia go to bed first, and could not see it through the transom.  the theory i <have|give> form <seem|appear> absurd at <first|low>, but a i <think|remember> it over, it probability grow on me. i take dinner at bellwood and start for town almost immediately after.  margery <have|take> <go|run> to miss letitia's room, and wardrop be pace up and down the veranda, smoke. he look deject and anxious, and he welcome my suggestion that he walk down to the station with me. a we go, a <man|humanity> emerge from the tree across and come slowly after u.  "you <see|consider>, i be <only|simply> nominally a free <agent|factor>," he say morosely. "they'll poison me yet; i <know|recognize> too much."  we say little on the way to the train. just before it come thunder along, however, he speak again.  "i be go away, knox. there isn't anything in this political game for me, and the law be too long. i have a chum in <mexico|Mexico>, and he want me to go down there."  "permanently?"  "yes. there's nothing to <hold|keep> me here now," he say.  <i|single> turn and face him in the glare of the station light.  "what do you mean?" i demand.  "i mean that there isn't any longer a reason why one <part|break> of the earth be better than another. mexico or alaska, it's all the same to me."  he turn on his heel and <leave|will> me. i watch him swing up the path, with his head down; i saw the shadowy figure of the other man fall into line behind him. then i catch the platform of the last car a it pas, and that short ride into town be a triumphal <procession|advancement> with the wheel <beat|dead> time and sing: "it's all the same--the same--to me--to me."  i call <burton|Richard_Burton> by telephone, and be lucky enough to find him at the office. he say he have just <get|have> in, and, a <usual|common>, he want something to eat. we arrange to meet at a little chinese restaurant, where at that hour, nine o'clock, we would be almost alone. later on, after the theater, i know that the place would be full of people, and conversation impossible.  burton know the place well, a he <do|make> every restaurant in the city.  "hello, mike," he say to the unctuous chinaman who admit u. and "mike" smile a slant-eye welcome. the room be empty; it be an unpretentious affair, with lace curtain at the window and small, very clean table. at one <corner|niche> a cable and slide communicate through a <hole|mess> in the ceiling with the floor above, and through the aperture, burton's order for chicken and rice, and the inevitable tea, be bark.  burton listen attentively to wardrop's story, a i repeat it.  "so schwartz do it, after all!" he say regretfully, when i finish. "it's a <tame|subdue> end. it have all the element of the unusual, and it resolve itself into an ordinary, every-<day|daylight>, man-to-man feud. i'm disappoint; we can't touch schwartz."  "i think the _times-post_ <be|follow> hot after him."  "schwartz buy the _times-post_ at three o'clock this afternoon," burton say, with repress rage. "i'm call off. to-morrow we run a photograph of schwartzwold, his <place|localize> at plattsburg, and the next day we eulogize the administration. i'm go down the river on an excursion boat, and write up the <pig|copper>-kill contest at the <union|sum> butchers' picnic."  "how be mr. butler?" i ask, a his rage subside to mere rumble in his throat.  "delirious"--shortly. "she's go to croak, wardrop's <go|fling> to mexico, schwartz will be next governor, and miss maitland's body will be <find|see> in a cistern. the whole thing have petered out. what's the use of find the murderer if he's coat with asbestos and line with money? mike, i want some more tea to drown my trouble."  we call up the hospital <about|around> ten-thirty, and learn that mr. butler be sink. fred be there, and without much hope of get anything, we go over. i take <burton|Richard_Burton> in a a nephew of the die woman, and i be glad i <have|make> do it. she be quite conscious, but very weak. she tell the story to fred and myself, and in a <corner|box> burton take it down in shorthand. we get her to sign it about daylight sometime, and she die very quietly shortly after edith arrive at eight.  to give her story a she give it would be impossible; the <ramble|meander> of a sick mind, the terrible pathos of it all, be impossible to repeat. she lay there, her long, thin body practically dead, fight the death rattle in her throat. there be pause when for five minute she would lie in a stupor, only to rouse and go forward from the very <word|countersign> where she have stop.  she <begin|get> with her marry <life|spirit>, and to understand the beauty of it be to <understand|see> the <thing|affair> that come after. she be perfectly, ideally, illogically happy. <then|so> one day henry butler accept the nomination for state treasurer, and with that thing change. during his term in office he alter greatly; his wife could only guess that thing be wrong, for he refuse to <talk|sing>.  the crash <come|descend>, after all, with terrible suddenness. there have be an all-night <conference|group_discussion> at the butler home, and mr. butler, in a frenzy at <find|ascertain> himself a dupe, have call the butler from bed and forcibly eject fleming and schwartz from the house. ellen butler <have|let> be horrify, sicken by what she regard a the vulgarity of the occurrence. but her loyalty to her husband never waver.  butler be one honest man against a complete <organization|organisation> of unscrupulous one. his disgrace, imprisonment and suicide at the white cat have follow in rapid succession. with his <death|decease>, all that be worth while in his wife die. her health be destroy; she <become|get> one of the <wretched|deplorable> army of neurasthenic, with only one idea: to retaliate, to pay back in <measure|step> full and run over, her wreck life, her dead husband, her grief and her shame.  she lay her plan with the caution and absolute recklessness of a diseased mentality. normally a shrink, nervous woman, she become cold, passionless, <deliberate|debate> in her revenge. to disgrace schwartz and fleming be her original intention. but she could not get the <paper|newspaper>.  she resort to hound fleming, <mean|average> to drive him to suicide. and she <choose|take> a method that have more nearly drive him to madness. wherever he turn he find the figure eleven twenty-two c. sometimes just the <number|enumerate>, without the letter. it have <be|follow> henry butler's cell number during his imprisonment, and if they be grave <on|along> his wife's soul, they burn themselves in line of fire on fleming's brain. for over a year she pursue this course--sometimes through the <mail|post>, at other time in the most unexpected place, wherever she could bribe a messenger to carry the paper. sane? no, hardly sane, but inevitable a fate.  the time <come|follow> when other thing go badly with <fleming|Sir_Alexander_Fleming>, a i have already hear from wardrop. where be halsey?  "he be here, wasn't he?" mr. jarvis persist.  "he stop at the club on his way over."  "i--don't know where he be," <i|single> say feebly.  one of the <men|man> from the club <come|get> in, ask for the <telephone|call>, and i could hear him excitedly talk, say something about coroner and detective.  mr. jarvis lean over to me.  "why don't you trust me, miss innes?" he say.  "if i can do anything i will.  but tell me the whole thing."  i <do|make>, finally, from the <begin|commence>, and when <i|single> tell of <jack|tar> bailey's be in the house that night, he give a long whistle.  "i wish they be both here," he say when i finish.  "whatever <mad|frantic> prank take them away, it would look better if they be here. <especially|particularly>--"  "especially what?"  "especially since jack bailey and arnold armstrong be notoriously bad friend.  it <be|follow> bailey who <get|take> arnold into trouble last spring--something about the <bank|cant>.  and then, too--"  "go on," i say.  "if there be anything more, i ought to know."  "there's nothing more," he say evasively.  "there's just one thing we may bank on, miss innes.  any <court|romance> in the country will acquit a man who kill an intruder in his house, at night.  if halsey--"  "why, you don't think halsey do it!" i exclaim.  there <be|follow> a <queer|curious> feel of <physical|forcible> nausea come over me.  "no, no, not at all," he say with <force|storm> cheerfulness.  "come, miss innes, you're a <ghost|shade> of yourself and i be <go|fling> to help you up-stair and call your maid.  this <have|make> be too much for you."  liddy help me back to <bed|layer>, and under the impression that i be in danger of freeze to death, put a hot-water bottle over my <heart|nerve> and another at my foot.  then she leave me.  it be <early|other> dawn <now|immediately>, and from voice under my window i surmise that mr. jarvis and his companion be search the ground.  a for me, i lay in <bed|bottom>, with every faculty awake.  where have halsey <go|get>? how have he go, and when? before the murder, no doubt, but who would believe that?  if either he or jack bailey have hear an intruder in the house and shoot him--a they might <have|take> be justify in do--why have they run away?  the whole thing be unheard of, outrageous, and--impossible to ignore.  about six o'clock gertrude come in.  she be fully dress, and <i|single> sit up nervously.  "poor aunty!" she say.  "what a shock night you have <have|take>!" she come over and sit down <on|along> the bed, and i saw she look very tire and <wear|weary>.  "be there anything new?" i ask anxiously.  "nothing.  the car be go, but warner"--he be the chauffeur--"warner be at the lodge and know nothing <about|around> it."  "well," i say, "if i ever get my hand on halsey innes, i shall not let go until i have tell him a few thing.  when we get this clear up, i be go back to the city to be quiet.  one more night like the last two will end me.  the peace of the country--fiddle stick!"  whereupon i tell gertrude of the noise the night before, and the <figure|number> on the veranda in the east wing.  a an afterthought i bring out the pearl cuff-link.  "i have no doubt now," i say, "that it be arnold armstrong the night before last, <too|excessively>.  he have a key, no doubt, but why he should steal into his father's house i can not imagine.  he could have come with my permission, easily enough.  anyhow, whoever it be that night, leave this little souvenir."  gertrude take one look at the cuff-<link|yoke>, and go a white a the pearl in it; she clutch at the foot of the bed, and stand star. a for me, i be quite a astonish a she <be|follow>.  "where do--you--find it?" she ask finally, with a desperate effort at calm.  and while i tell her she stand look out of the window with a look i could not fathom on her face.  it be a relief when mr. watson tap at the door and bring me some tea and toast.  the cook be in bed, <completely|entirely> demoralize, she report, and liddy, brave with the daylight, be <look|see> for <footprint|footmark> around the house.  mr. watson herself be a wreck; she be <blue|dreary>-white around the <lip|mouth>, and she have one hand tie up.  she say she have fall down-stair in her excitement.  it be natural, of course, that the thing would shock her, <have|suffer> <be|follow> the armstrongs' housekeeper for several year, and know mr. arnold well.  gertrude have slip out during my talk with mr. watson, and i dress and <go|run> down-stair.  the billiard and card-room be lock until the coroner and the detective <get|convey> there, and the men from the club have go back for more conventional clothe.  i could hear thomas in the pantry, alternately wail for mr. arnold, a he call him, and cite the token that have precursed the <murder|mutilate>. the house seem to choke me, and, slip a shawl around me, i go out on the drive.  at the corner by the east wing i meet liddy.  her skirt be draggle with dew to her knee, and her hair be still in crimp.  "go right in and change your clothe," i say sharply.  "you're a sight, and at your age!"  she have a golf-stick in her hand, and she say she have <find|happen> it on the lawn.  there be nothing unusual about it, but it <occur|come> to me that a golf-stick with a metal end might have be the object that have scratch the stair near the card-room.  i take it from her, and send her up for dry <garment|dress>.  her daylight courage and self-importance, and her shudder <delight|joy> in the mystery, irritate me beyond word. after i <leave|allow> her i make a circuit of the build.  nothing seem to <be|follow> disturb: the house look a calm and peaceful in the <morning|aurora> sun a it have the day i have be coerce into take it.  there be nothing to show that inside have be mystery and violence and sudden death.  in one of the tulip bed back of the house an early blackbird be peck viciously at something that glitter in the light. i pick my way gingerly over through the dew and stoop down: almost bury in the soft grind be a revolver!  i scrap the earth off it with the tip of my shoe, and, pick it up, slip it into my <pocket|sack>.  not until i have get into my bedroom and <double|treble>-lock the door do i venture to take it out and <examine|see> it.  one <look|smell> be all i need.  it be halsey's revolver.  i have unpack it the day before and put it <on|along> his shave-stand, and there could be no mistake.  his name be on a small silver plate on the handle.  i seem to see a network close around my boy, innocent a i know he be.  the revolver--i be afraid of them, but anxiety give me courage to look through the <barrel|cask>--the revolver <have|take> still two bullet in it.  i could only breathe a prayer of thankfulness that i have find the revolver before any sharp-eye detective have come around.  i decide to keep what clue i have, the cuff-link, the golf-stick and the revolver, in a <secure|strong> place until i could see some reason for <display|presentation> them.  the cuff-link have be <drop|shed> into a <little|small> filigree box on my toilet table.  i open the box and <felt|find> around for it.  the <box|corner> be empty--the cuff-link have disappear!     at ten o'clock the <casanova|Giovanni_Jacopo_Casanova_de_Seingalt> hack bring up three men.  they introduce themselves a the coroner of the county and two <detective|investigator> from the city.  the coroner <lead|go> the way at once to the <lock|interlock> wing, and with the aid of one of the detective <examine|try> the room and the body.  the other detective, after a <short|poor> scrutiny of the dead man, busy himself with the outside of the house.  it be only after they have get a <fair|reasonable> idea of thing a they be that they send for me.  i receive them in the live-room, and i have make up my mind exactly what to tell.  i have take the <house|sign> for the summer, i say, while the armstrong be in california.  in spite of a rumor among the servant about strange noise--i cite thomas--nothing have <occur|come> the first two night.  on the third night i believe that some one have be in the house: i have hear a crash sound, but be alone with one maid have not investigate.  the house have be lock in the morning and apparently undisturbed.  then, a <clearly|distinctly> a i could, i relate how, the night before, a shoot have rouse u; that my niece and i have investigate and find a body; that i do not know who the murder man be until mr. jarvis from the club inform me, and that i know of no reason why mr. arnold armstrong should steal into his father's house at night.  i should have be glad to allow him entree there at any time.  "have you reason to believe, miss innes," the coroner ask, "that any member of your household, imagine mr. armstrong be a burglar, shoot him in self-defense?"  "i have no reason for think so," i say quietly.  "your theory be that mr. armstrong be follow here by some enemy, and shoot a he enter the <house|household>?"  "i don't think i have a theory," i say.  "the thing that <have|get> puzzle me be why mr. armstrong should enter his father's house two night in succession, steal in like a thief, when he need only to ask <entrance|charm> to be admit."  the coroner be a very silent man: he take some note after this, but he seem <anxious|uneasy> to make the next train back to <town|township>.  he set the inquest for the follow saturday, <give|establish> mr. jamieson, the younger of the two detective, and the more intelligent look, a few instruction, and, after gravely shake hand with me and regret the unfortunate affair, take his departure, accompany by the other <detective|investigator>.  i be just begin to breathe freely when mr. jamieson, who have be stand by the window, come over to me.  "the family consist of yourself alone, miss innes?"  "my niece be here," i say.  "there be no one but yourself and your niece?"  "my nephew."  i have to moisten my lip.  "oh, a nephew.  i should like to see him, if he be here."  "he be not here just now," i say a quietly a i could.  "i expect him--at any time."  "he be here yesterday even, i believe?"  "no--yes."  "didn't he have a guest with him?  another <man|gentleman>?"  "he bring a friend with him to stay over sunday, mr. bailey."  "mr. john bailey, the cashier of the traders' <bank|cant> i believe." and i know that some one at the greenwood <club|order> <have|give> tell.  "when do they <leave|give>?"  "very early--i don't know at <just|hardly> what time."  mr. jamieson turn <suddenly|abruptly> and look at me.  "please try to be more explicit," he say.  "you say your nephew and mr. <bailey|Pearl_Bailey> be in the house last night, and yet you and your niece, with some woman-servant, find the <body|consistence>.  where be your nephew?"  i be entirely desperate by that time.  "i do not know," i cry, "but be sure of this: halsey know nothing of this thing, and no amount of circumstantial evidence can make an <innocent|free> <man|gentleman> guilty."  "sit down," he say, push forward a chair.  "there be some <thing|affair> i have to tell you, and, in return, <please|delight> tell me all you know.  believe me, thing always come out.  in the first place, mr. armstrong be <shoot|take> from above.  the bullet <be|follow> fire at close range, enter below the shoulder and come out, after pas through the heart, well down the <back|cover>.  in other word, i believe the murderer stand on the stair and fire down.  in the second place, i <find|happen> on the edge of the billiard-table a char cigar which have burn itself partly out, and a <cigarette|butt> which have consume itself to the cork <tip|tumble>.  neither one <have|get> be more than light, then put down and forget.  have you any idea what it be that make your nephew and mr. bailey leave their cigar and their game, take out the automobile without call the chauffeur, and all this at--let me see certainly <before|earlier> three o'clock in the <morning|dawn>?"  "i don't know," i say; "but depend on it, mr. jamieson, halsey will be back himself to explain everything."  "i sincerely hope so," he say.  "miss innes, <have|take> it occur to you that mr. bailey might know something of this?"  gertrude have come down-stair and just a he speak she come in. i <saw|consider> her stop suddenly, a if she <have|give> be strike.  "he do not," she say in a tone that be not her own.  "mr. bailey and my <brother|chum> know nothing of this.  the murder be <commit|give> at three.  they leave the <house|home> at a quarter before three."  "how do you know that?" mr. jamieson ask oddly.  "do you know at what time they <leave|give>?"  "i do," gertrude answer firmly.  "at a quarter before three my <brother|crony> and mr. bailey leave the house, by the main <entrance|fascinate>. i--<be|follow>--there."  "gertrude," i say excitedly, "you be dream!  why, at a quarter to three--"  "listen," she say.  "at half-past two the downstairs <telephone|call> ring. i have not go to sleep, and i hear it.  then i hear halsey answer it, and in a few minute he come up-stair and knock at my door. we--we talk for a minute, <then|so> i put on my dress-gown and slipper, and go down-stair with him.  mr. bailey be in the billiard-room.  we--we all <talk|sing> together for perhaps ten minute. then it be <decide|settle> that--that they should both go away--"  "can't you be more explicit?" mr. jamieson <ask|expect>.  "why do they go away?"  "i be only tell you what happen, not why it happen," she say evenly.  "halsey go for the car, and instead of bring it to the house and rouse people, he go by the lower road from the stable. mr. bailey be to meet him at the <foot|base> of the lawn.  mr. bailey leave--"  "which way?" mr. jamieson ask sharply.  "by the <main|independent> entrance.  he leave--it be a quarter to three.  i know exactly."  "the clock in the hall be stop, miss innes," say jamieson. nothing seem to escape him.  "he look at his watch," she reply, and i could <see|ensure> mr. jamieson's snap, a if he have make a discovery.  a for myself, during the whole <recital|yarn> i have <be|follow> plunge into the deepest amazement.  "will you pardon me for a personal question?"  the detective be a youngish man, and i think he be somewhat embarrass.  "what be your--your <relation|intercourse> with mr. bailey?"  gertrude <hesitate|waver>.  then she come over and put her hand lovingly in mine.  "i be engage to marry him," she say simply.  i have <grow|acquire> so accustom to surprise that i could only gasp again, and a for gertrude, the hand that lay in mine be burn with fever.  "and--after that," mr. jamieson <go|run> on, "you <go|get> directly to <bed|know>?"  gertrude hesitate.  "no," she say finally.  "i--i be not nervous, and after i have extinguish the light, i remember something i have leave in the billiard-room, and i felt my way back there through the darkness."  "will you tell me what it be you <have|get> forget?"  "i can not tell you," she say slowly.  "i--i do not leave the billiard-room at once--"  "why?"  the detective's tone be imperative.  "this be very important, miss innes."  "i be cry," gertrude say in a low tone.  "when the french clock in the draw-room strike three, i get <up|upward>, and then--i hear a step on the east porch, just outside the card-room.  some one with a key <be|follow> work with the latch, and i think, of course, of halsey.  when we take the <house|mansion> he call that his entrance, and he have carry a key for it ever since.  the door open and <i|single> <be|follow> about to ask what he have forget, when there be a <flash|garish> and a report.  some heavy body drop, and, half craze with terror and shock, i run through the draw-room and get up-stair--i scarcely remember how."  she drop into a chair, and i think mr. jamieson must have finish.  but he be not through.  "you certainly clear your brother and mr. bailey admirably," he say. "the testimony be invaluable, especially in view of the fact that your brother and mr. armstrong <have|get>, i believe, quarrel rather seriously some time ago."  "nonsense," i break in.  "thing be bad enough, mr. jamieson, without invent bad feel where it doesn't exist.  gertrude, i don't think halsey know the--the <murder|mutilate> man, <do|make> he?"  but mr. jamieson be sure of his grind.  "the quarrel, i believe," he persist, "be about mr. armstrong's conduct to you, miss gertrude.  he have be pay you unwelcome attention."  and i have never see the <man|mankind>!  when she nod a "yes" i <saw|consider> the tremendous possibility involve. if this detective could prove that gertrude fear and dislike the <murder|execution> man, and that mr. armstrong <have|take> be annoy and possibly pursue her with hateful attention, all that, add to gertrude's confession of her presence in the billiard-room at the time of the crime, <look|spirit> strange, to say the least.  the prominence of the family assure a strenuous effort to find the murderer, and if we have nothing worse to look <forward|ahead> to, we be <sure|certain> of a distasteful publicity.  mr. jamieson shut his <note|mention>-book with a snap, and thank u.  "i have an idea," he say, apropos of nothing at all, "that at any rate the ghost be lay here.  whatever the rappings have be--and the <color|distort> <man|humanity> say they begin when the family go west three month ago--they be likely to stop now."  which show how much he know about it.  the ghost be not lay: with the murder of arnold armstrong he, or it, only seem to take <on|along> fresh <vigor|energy>.  mr. jamieson leave then, and when gertrude have go up-stair, a she do at once, i sit and think over what i have just hear. her <engagement|conflict>, once so engross a <matter|affair>, pal now beside the significance of her story.  if halsey and jack <bailey|Bailey> have leave before the crime, how come halsey's revolver in the tulip bed? what be the mysterious <cause|crusade> of their sudden flight?  what have gertrude leave in the billiard-room?  what be the significance of the cuff-link, and where be it?     when the detective leave he <enjoin|say> absolute secrecy on everybody in the household.  the greenwood club promise the same <thing|affair>, and a there be no sunday afternoon paper, the <murder|mangle> be not publicly know until monday.  the coroner himself notify the armstrong family lawyer, and early in the afternoon he come out. i have not see mr. jamieson since <morning|dawn>, but i know he have be interrogate the servant.  gertrude be lock in her room with a headache, and i have luncheon alone.  mr. harton, the lawyer, be a little, thin man, and he look a if he do not relish his business that day.  "this be very unfortunate, miss innes," he say, after we have shake hand.  "most unfortunate--and mysterious.  with the <father|don> and <mother|fuss> in the <west|westward>, <i|single> find everything devolve on me; and, a you can <understand|realize>, it be an unpleasant duty."  "no doubt," i say absently.  "mr. harton, i be go to ask you some question, and i hope you will <answer|do> them.  i <feel|find> that i be entitle to some knowledge, because i and my family be just now in a most ambiguous position."  i don't know whether he <understand|realize> me or not: he take of his <glass|chalk> and wipe them.  "i shall be very happy," he say with old-fashion <courtesy|good_manners>.  "thank you.  mr. harton, do mr. arnold <armstrong|Louis_Armstrong> know that sunnyside have be rent?"  "i think--yes, he do.  in fact, <i|single> myself tell him about it."  "and he know who the tenant <be|follow>?"  "yes."  "he <have|make> not be live with the family for some year, i believe?"  "no.  unfortunately, there have be trouble between arnold and his father.  for two year he have live in town."  "<then|so> it would be unlikely that he come here last night to <get|go> possession of anything belong to him?" he suggest that we have prayer over the <body|trunk> when we place them in the boat, and i agree to read the burial service from the <episcopal|pontifical> prayer book.  the voice from turner's cabin come steadily, miss lee's low tone, turner's heavy bass only <now|immediately> and then.  once <i|single> hear her give a startle exclamation, and both jones and i leap to the <door|doorway>.  but the next <moment|instant> she be talk again quietly.  ten minute--fifteen--pas.  i grow restless and take to wander about the cabin.  mr. john come to the door opposite, and ask to have tea send down to the <stewardess|hostess>.  i call the request up the companionway, unwilling to <leave|will> the cabin for a moment.  when i come back, jones be stand at the <door|threshold> of vail's cabin, look in.  his face be pale.  "look there!" he say hoarsely.  "look at the bell.  he must have try to push the button!"  i star in.  williams have put the cabin to <right|rectify>, a nearly a he could.  the soak mattress be go, and a clean linen sheet be spread over the bunk.  <poor|short> vail's clothe, a he have take it off the night before, hang on a mahogany stand beside the bed, and above, <almost|nearly> conceal by his coat, be the bell.  jones's eye be <fix|make> on the darkish <smear|stain>, over and around the bell, <on|along> the white paint.  i measure the height of the bell from the bed.  it be well above, and to one side--a smear rather than a print, too indeterminate to <be|follow> of any value, sinister, cruel.  "he didn't do that, charlie," i say.  "he couldn't have get up to it after--that be the murderer's mark.  he lean there, one hand against the wall, to <look|expect> down at his work. and, without know it, he press the button that rouse the two woman."  he have not hear the story of henrietta sloane, and, a we wait, i tell him.  some of the tension be relax.  he try, in his argumentative german way, to drag me into a discussion a to the foreordination of a death that result from an accidental ring of a bell.  but my ear be alert for the voice near by, and soon miss lee open the <door|threshold>.  turner be sit on his bunk.  he have make an attempt to shave, and have cut his chin severely.  he be in a dress-gown, and be hold a handkerchief to his face; he peer at me over it with red-<rim|brim> eye.  "this--this be horrible, leslie," he say.  "i can hardly believe it."  "it be true, mr. turner."  he <take|assume> the handkerchief away and look to see if the bleed have stop.  i believe he intend to impress u both with his coolness, but it be an unfortunate attempt.  his lip, <relieve|excuse> of the pressure, be twitch; his nerveless finger could hardly refold the handkerchief.  "wh-why be i not--call at once?" he demand.  "i notify you.  you <be|follow>--you must have go to sleep again."  "i don't believe you call me.  you're--lie, aren't you?"  he get up, steady himself by the <wall|fence>, and sway dizzily to the motion of the ship.  "you shut me off down here, and then run thing your own damn way."  he turn <on|along> miss lee.  "where's helen?"  "in her room, marsh.  she <have|let> one of her headache.  please don't disturb her."  "where's williams?" he turn to me.  "i can get him for you."  "tell him to <bring|get> me a highball.  my mouth's sticky."  he run his tongue over his dry lip.  "and--take a message from me to richardson--"  he stop, startle.  indeed, miss lee and i have both start.  "to who's run the boat, anyhow?  singleton?"  "mr. singleton <be|follow> a prisoner in the <forward|forth> <house|mansion>," i say gravely.  the <effect|issue> of this be astonish.  he star at u both, and, find corroboration in miss lee's face, his own take on an instant expression of relief.  he drop to the side of the <bed|love>, and his color <come|follow> slowly back.  he even smile--a crafty grin that be inexpressibly horrible.  "singleton!" he say.  "why do they--how do they know it <be|follow> he?"  "he have quarrel with the captain last night, and he be on duty at the time of the when the thing happen.  the man at the wheel claim to <have|take> see him in the chartroom just before, and there be other evidence, i believe.  the lookout saw him forward, with something--possibly the axe.  not decisive, of course, but enough to justify put him in iron.  somebody do it, and the murderer <be|follow> on board, mr. turner."  his grin have fade, but the crafty look in his pale-blue eye remain.  "the chart-room be dark.  how could the steersman--"  he <check|ensure> himself abruptly, and look at u both quickly.  "where be--they?" he <ask|take> in a different tone.  "on deck."  "we can't keep them in this weather."  "we must," i say.  "we will have to get to the nearest port a quickly a we can, and surrender ourselves and the body.  this thing will <have|make> to be sift to the bottom, mr. turner.  the innocent must not suffer for the guilty, and every one on the ship be under suspicion."  he fell into a passion at that, insist that the body be bury at once, assert his ownership of the vessel a his authority, <demand|need> to know what i, a forecastle hand, <have|make> to say <about|around> it, fling up and down the <small|modest> room, shower me with invective and threat, and shove miss lee aside when she lay a calm hand on his <arm|branch>.  the <cut|issue> on his chin be bleed again, add to his wild and sinister expression.  he end by demand williams.  i open the door and call to charlie jones to send the butler, and stand by, wait for the fresh explosion that be come. williams shakily confess that there be no whiskey on board.  "where be it?" turner thunder.  williams look at me.  he be in a <state|land> of inarticulate fright.  "i order it overboard," i say.  turner <whirl|swirl> on me, incredulity and rage in his face.  "you!"  i put the best face i could on the matter, and eye him steadily. "there <have|give> be too much drink <on|along> this ship," i say.  "if you doubt it, go up and look at the three <body|consistence> on the <deck|floor>."  "what have you to do about it?"  his eye be narrow; there be menace in every line of his <face|brass>.  "with schwartz <go|get>, captain richardson dead, and singleton in iron, the crew <have|take> no officer.  they ask me to take charge."  "so!  and you use your authority to meddle with what do not concern you  the ship have an officer while i be on it.  and there will be no mutiny."  he fling into the main cabin, and make for the forward companionway. i step back to allow miss lee to precede me.  she be stand, her back to the <dress|arrange>-stand, face the <door|threshold>.  she <look|appear> at me and make a helpless gesture with her hand, a if the situation be beyond her. then i saw her look down.  she take a quick step or two toward the door, and, stoop pick up some small object from almost under my foot.  the incident would have pas without notice, have she not, in attempt to wrap it in her handkerchief, drop it.  i saw then that it be a key.  "let me <get|come> it for you," i say.  to my amazement, she put her foot over it.  "please see what mr. turner <be|follow> do," she say.  "it be the key to my jewel-case."  "will you let me see it?"  "no."  "it be not the key to a jewel-case."  "it do not concern you what it be."  "it be the key to the storeroom door."  "you be stronger than i be.  you look the brute.  you can knock me away and get it."  i know then, of course, that it be the storeroom <key|name>.  but i could not take it by force.  and so defiantly she face me, so valiant be every line of her slight figure, that i be ashamed of my impulse to push her <aside|digression> and take it.  i <love|know> her with every inch of my overgrow body, and i do the thing she know i would do.  i bow and leave the cabin. but i <have|give> no intention of lose the key.  i could not take it by force, but she know a well a i do what find it there in turner's <room|way> mean.  turner have lock me in. but i must be able to <prove|establish> it--my wit against hers, and the advantage mine.  i have the woman under <guard|safety>.  i go up on deck.  a curious spectacle reveal itself.  turner, purple with anger, be harangue the <men|human>, who stand amidships, huddle together, but grim and determine withal.  burn, a little apart from the rest, be stand, sullen, his arm fold.  a turner cease, he <take|acquire> a step forward.  "you be right, mr. turner," he say.  "it's your ship, and it's up to you to say where she go and how she go, sir.  but some one <will|leave> hang for this, mr. turner,--some one that's on this <deck|floor> now; and the body be go back with u--likewise the axe.  there ain't go to be a mistake--the <right|good> man be go to swing."  "that's mutiny!"  "yes, sir," burn acknowledge, his face pal a little.  "i guess you could call it that."  turner swing on his heel and go below, where jones, relieve of guard duty by burn, report him lock in his room, refuse admission to his wife and miss lee, both of whom have knock <on|along> the door.  the trouble with turner add to the general misery of the situation. burn get our position at noon with more or le exactness, and the general work of the ella go on well enough.  but the situation be indescribable.  <men|valet> start if a penknife <drop|flatten>, and swear if a sail flap.  the <call|forebode> of the boatswain's pipe rasp their ear, and the preparation for stow the body in the jolly-boat leave them unnerve and sick.  some sort of a meal be cook, but no one could eat; williams bring up, untasted, the luncheon he have carry down to the after house.  at two o'clock all <hand|paw> gather amidships, and the body <be|follow> carry forward to where the boat, lower in it davit and brace, lay on the deck.  it have <be|follow> line with canvas and tarpaulin, and a cover of similar material <lay|repose> ready to be nail in place.  all the <men|world> be bareheaded.  many be in tear.  miss lee come forward with u, and it be from her prayer-<book|record> that i, too move for self-consciousness, read the burial-service.  "i be the resurrection and the life," i read huskily.  the figure at my foot, in their canvas shroud, roll gently with the rock of the ship; the sun beat down on the <deck|floor>, <on|along> the bare head of the men, on the gild edge of the <prayer|entreaty>-book, gleam in the light, on the last of the land-bird, droop in the heat on the main cross-<tree|corner>.  "... for man walketh in a vain shadow," i read, "and disquieteth himself in vain....  "o spare me a little, that i may recover my strength: before i go hence, and be no more see."      mr. john and the stewardess come up late in the afternoon.  we <have|get> rail off a part of the <deck|floor> around the forward companionway for them, and none of the crew except the <man|mankind> on guard be allow inside the rope.  after a consultation, find the ship very short-hand, and unwilling with the night <come|get> on to <trust|believe> any of the men, burn and i decide to take over this duty ourselves, and, by <station|place> ourselves at the top of the companionway, to combine the <duty|tariff> of officer on watch and guard of the after house.  to <make|take> the woman doubly secure, we have oleson nail all the window <close|closely>, although they be merely porthole.  jones be no longer on guard below, and i have exchange singleton's worthless revolver for my own serviceable one.  mr. john, carefully dress, <survey|resume> the rail-off deck with raise eyebrow.  "for--u?" she ask, <look|search> at me.  the men be gather about the wheel <aft|astern>, and be out of ear-shoot.  mr. sloane have drop into a steamer-chair, and be lie back with close eye.  "yes, mr. john."  "where have you put them?"  i point to where the jolly-boat, on the port side of the ship, swing on it davit.  "and the mate, mr. singleton?"  "he <be|follow> in the forward house."  "what do you do with the--the weapon?"  "why do you ask that?"  "morbid curiosity," she say, with a lightness of <tone|smell> that ring false to my ear.  "and then--naturally, i should like to be sure that it be safely overboard, so it will not be"--she shiver--"<use|apply> again."  "it be not overboard, mr. john," i say <gravely|badly>.  "it be lock in a <safe|good> place, where it will remain until the police <come|get> to take it."  "you be rather theatrical, aren't you?" she scoff, and turn away. but a second later she come back to me, and put her hand on my arm. "tell me where it be," she beg.  "you be make a mystery of it, and i detest mystery."  i saw <under|below> her mask of lightness then: she want desperately to know where the axe be.  her eye fell, under my gaze.  "i be sorry.  there be no <mystery|secret>.  it <be|follow> simply lock away for safe-keep."  she <bite|sting> her lip.  "do you know what i think?" she say slowly.  "i think you <have|let> hypnotize the crew, a you <do|make> me--at first.  why have no <one|nonpareil> remember that you be in the after house last night, that you find <poor|piteous> wilmer vail, that you raise the alarm, that you discover the captain and karen?  why should i not call the men here and remind them of all that?"  "i do not believe you <will|leave>.  they know i be lock in the storeroom. the door--the lock--"  "you could have lock yourself in."  "you do not know what you be say!"  but i have anger her, and she go on cruelly:--  "who be you, anyhow?  you be not a sailor.  you come here and be take on because you tell a hard-luck story.  how do we know that you come from a hospital?  <men|humanity> just out of prison look a you do. do you know what we call you, the first two day out?  we call you elsa's jail-<bird|fowl>  and now, because you have dominate the crew, we be in your hand!"  "do mr. turner and miss lee think that?"  "they feel a i do.  this be a pick crew men the turner <line|cable> have employ for year."  "you be very brave, mr. john," i say.  "if i be what you think i be, i would <be|follow> a dangerous enemy."  "i <be|follow> not afraid of you."  i think fast.  she be right.  it have not occur to me before, but it sweep over me overwhelmingly.  "you <be|follow> leave me only one thing to do," i say.  "i shall surrender myself to the men at once."  i take out my revolver and hold it out to her.  "this rope be a <dead|short>-line.  the crew know, and you will <have|make> no trouble; but you must stand guard here until some one else be send."  she take the revolver without a <word|countersign>, and, somewhat daze by this new turn of event, i go aft.  the men be gather there, and i surrender myself.  they listen in silence while i tell them the situation.  burn, who have be try to sleep, sit up and star at me incredulously.  "it will leave you pretty short-hand, boy," i finish, "but you'd better fasten me up somewhere.  but <i|single> want to be sure of one thing first: whatever happen, keep the <guard|ward> for the woman."  "we'd like to <talk|sing> it over, leslie," burn say, after a word with the others.  i go forward a few <foot|hoof>, <take|consider> care to remain where they could see me, and very soon they call me.  there <have|get> <be|follow> a dispute, i believe. adam and mcnamara stand off from the others, their <face|confront> not unfriendly, but <clearly|distinctly> differ from the decision.  charlie jones, who, by reason of long service and a sort of pious control he have in the forecastle, be generally spokesman for the crew, take a step or two toward me.  "we'll not <do|make> it, boy," he say.  "we think we know a man when we see one, a well a have occasion to know that you're white all through. and we're not incline to set the talk of woman against what we think <best|good> to do.  <so|thus> you stick to your job, and we're back of you."  in spite of myself, i choke up.  i try to tell them what their loyalty mean to me; but i could only hold out my <hand|reach>, and, one by one, they come <up|upward> and shake it solemnly.  "we <think|consider>," mcnamara say, when, last of all, he and <adam|go> <come|do> up, "that it would be best, lad, if we put down in the log-book all that have happen last night and to-<day|daylight>, and this just now, too.  it's <fresh|new> in our <mind|judgment> now, and it will be something to go by."  so burn and i get the log-book from the captain's cabin.  the axe be there, where we have place it <earlier|early> in the <day|daytime>, lie on the white cover of the <bed|love>.  the room be untouched, a the dead man <have|get> leave it--a collar on the stand, brush put down hastily, a half-<smoke|pot> cigar which have burn a long scar on the wood before it <have|get> go out. we go out silently, burn carry the book, i lock the <door|doorway> behind u.  mr. john, sit near the companionway with the revolver on her knee, look up and eye me coolly.  "so they would not do it!"  "i be sorry to disappoint you--they would not."  she hold up my revolver to me, and smile cynically.  "remember," she say, "i only say you be a possibility."  "thank you; i shall remember."  by unanimous consent, the task of put down what have happen be <give|open> to me.  i have a copy of the log-book before me now, the <one|i> that <be|follow> use at the trial.  the men read it through before they sign it.                                                     august thirteenth.  this morning, between two-thirty and three o'clock, three <murder|dispatch> be commit on the yacht ella.  at the request of mr. john, one of the party <on|along> board, i have move to the after house to sleep, put my <blanket|cover> and pillow in the storeroom and sleep on the floor there. mr. john give, a her reason, a fear of something <go|fling> wrong, a there be <trouble|difficulty> between mr. turner and the captain. <i|single> sleep with a revolver beside me and with the door of the storeroom open.  at some time shortly before three o'clock i waken with a feel of suffocation, and find that the door <be|follow> <close|nigh> and lock on the outside.  i suspect a joke among the crew, and set to <work|run> with my pen-knife to unscrew the lock.  when i have two <screw|know> out, a woman scream, and i break down the door.  a the main cabin be dark, i saw no one and could not tell where the <cry|scream> <come|get> from.  <i|single> run into mr. vail's cabin, next the <storeroom|stowage>, and call him.  his door be stand open.  i <hear|see> him breathe heavily.  then the breathe stop.  i strike a match, and find him dead.  his head have be crush in with an axe, the leave hand cut off, and there be gash on the right shoulder and the abdomen.  i know the helmsman would be at the wheel, and run up the after companionway to him and <tell|say> him.  then i run forward and call the first mate, mr. singleton, who be on duty.  he have be drink. i ask him to call the captain, but he do not.  he get his revolver, and we hurry down the forward companion.  the body of the captain be lie at the foot of the step, his <head|principal> on the lowest stair.  he have be kill like mr. vail.  his cap have <be|follow> place over his face.  the <mate|partner> <collapse|break> on the step.  i find the light switch and turn it on.  there be no one in the cabin or in the chart-room.  i run to mr. turner's room, go through mr. i look after him until he turn the next corner, and i know i have not be mistake; it be wardrop.  the next minute hunter appear, from the same <direction|commission>, and we walk quickly together. i tell him who the <man|human> just ahead have <be|follow>, and he nod without surprise. but before we turn the next corner he stop.  "do you ever <hear|see> of the white cat?" he ask. "little political club?"  "never."  "i'm a member of it," he go on rapidly. "it's run by the city ring, or rather it <run|go> itself. <be|follow> a good fellow while you're there, and <keep|save> your eye open. it's a queer joint."  the corner we turn find u on a narrow, badly pave street. the break window of the warehouse still look down on u, and across the street be an ice factory, with two desert wagon stand along the curb. a well a i could see for the darkness, a lumber yard stretch beyond the warehouse, it pile of board <give|establish> off in the rain the aromatic odor of fresh <pine|yearn>.  at a gate in the fence beyond the warehouse hunter stop. it be an ordinary wooden gate and it open with a thumb latch. beyond stretch a long, narrow, brick-pave alleyway, perhaps three <foot|hoof> wide, and light by the merest glimmer of a light ahead. hunter <go|fling> on regardless of puddle in the brick pave, and i stumble after him. a we advance, i could see that the light be a single electric bulb, hang over a second gate. while hunter fumble for a key in his <pocket|sack>, i have time to see that this gate have a yale lock, be provide, at the side, with an electric bell button, and have a letter slot cut in it.  hunter open the gate and precede me through it. the gate swing to and click behind me. after the gloom of the passageway, the small brick-pave <yard|pace> seem brilliant with <light|easy>. two wire be string it length, dot with many electric lamp. in a corner a strip tent stand out in grotesque <relief|rest>; it seem to be empty, and the weather be an easy explanation. from the two-story house beyond there come suddenly a <burst|collapse> of piano music and a none too steady masculine voice. hunter <turn|work> to me, with his foot <on|along> the wooden step.  "above everything else," he warn, "keep your temper. nobody give a hang in here whether you're the mayor of the town, the <champion|star> pool-player of the first ward, or the roundsman on the beat."  the door at the <top|summit> of the step be also yale-lock. we step at once into the kitchen, from which i imagine that the house face on another street, and that for obvious reason <only|simply> it rear entrance be use. the kitchen be bright and clean; it be litter, however, with half-cut loaf of bread, glass and empty bottle. over the range a man in his shirt sleeve be give his whole attention to a <slice|slit> of ham, sizzle on a skillet, and at a table near-by a young fellow, with his hair cut in a barber's oval over the back of his neck, be spread slice of bread and cheese with mustard.  "how be you, mr. mayor?" hunter say, a he shed his raincoat. "this be mr. knox, the <man|mankind> who's engineer the _star-eagle_ fight."  the man over the <range|image> wipe one greasy hand and hold it out to me.  "the cat be purr a welcome," he say, indicate the fry ham. "if my <cook|fix> <turn|go> out right i'll ask you to have some <ham|overact> with me. i don't know why in thunder it get black in the <middle|midway> and won't cook around the <edge|border>."  i recognize the mayor. he be a big fellow, handsome in a heavy way, and "tommy" to every <one|i> who <know|recognize> him. it seem i be about to see my city government at play.  hunter be thoroughly at home. he <take|consider> my coat and his own and hang them somewhere to dry. then he go into a sort of pantry open off the kitchen and come out with four bottle of beer.  "we <take|get> care of ourselves here," he explain, a the newly barber youth wash some glass. "if you want a sandwich, there <be|follow> cook <ham|overact> in the refrigerator and cheese--if our friend at the <sink|cesspool> have leave any."  the boy look up from his glass. "it's rat-trap cheese, that stuff," he growl.  "the other run out an hour ago and didn't come back," put in the mayor, grin. "you can kill that with mustard, if it's too lively."  "get some cigar, will you?" hunter ask me. "they're on a shelf in the pantry. i have my hand full."  i go for the cigar, remember to keep my eye <open|give>. the pantry be a small room: it contain an ice-box, stock with drinkable, ham, egg and butter. on shelve above be card, cigar and liquor, and there, <too|excessively>, i saw a box with an indorsement which show the "honor system" of the cat club.  "sign check and drop here," it read, and i <think|believe> about the old adage of honor among thieve and politician.  when i come out with the cigar hunter be stand with a group of new arrival; they include one of the city physician, the director of public charity and a judge of a local court. the latter, mcfeely, a little, thin irishman, know me and accost me at once. the mayor be <busy|officious> over the range, and be almost purple with heat and unwonted anxiety.  when the three <new|fresh>-comer go up-stair, instead of go into the grill-room, i look at hunter.  "<be|follow> this where the political game be play?" <i|single> <ask|take>.  "yes, if the political game be poker," he reply, and lead the <way|manner> into the room which adjoin the kitchen.  no one pay any attention to u. bare table, a wooden <floor|dump>, and almost a many cuspidor a chair, comprise the furniture of the long <room|board>. in one corner be a batter upright piano, and there <be|follow> two fireplace with <old|previous>-fashion mantel. perhaps a dozen men be sit around, talk loudly, with much scrap of chair on the bare <floor|story>. at one table they be throw poker dice, but the rest be drink beer and talk in a desultory way. at the piano a man with a red mustache be mimic the sextette from _lucia_ and a roar of applause meet u a we enter the room. hunter lead the way to a <corner|niche> and put down his bottle.  "it's fairly quiet to-night," he say. "to-morrow's the big night--saturday."  "what time do they close up?" i ask. in answer hunter point to a <sign|signal> over the door. it be a card, neatly <print|impress>, and it say, "the white cat never sleep."  "there be only two rule here," he explain. "that be one, and the other be, 'if you get too noisy, and the patrol wagon come, make the driver take you home.'"  the <crowd|herd> <be|follow> good-humor; it <pay|give> little or no attention to u, and when some one at the piano begin to thump a waltz, hunter, under cover of the noise, lean over to me.  "we trace fleming here, through your corner-man and the cabby," he say carefully. "i haven't see him, but it be a moral certainty he be skulk in one of the up-stair room. his precious private secretary be here, too."  i glance around the room, but no one be pay any attention to u.  "i don't know fleming by sight," the detective <go|turn> on, "and the picture we have of him be <take|have> a good <while|patch> ago, when he <wear|assume> a mustache. when he be in local politics, before he go to the <legislature|legislative_body>, he practically own this place, pay for favor with membership ticket. a man could hide here for a year safely. the police never come here, and a man's business be his own."  "he be up-stair now?"  "yes. there <be|follow> four room up there for card, and a bath-room. it's an old dwell house. would fleming know you?"  "no, but of course wardrop would."  a if in answer to my objection, wardrop appear at that moment. he run down the paint wooden stair and hurry through the room without look to right or leave. the piano keep on, and the <men|valet> at the table be still engross with their <glass|chalk> and one another. wardrop be very pale; he bolt into a <man|humanity> at the door, and push him aside without ceremony.  "you might go up now," hunter say, rise. "i will see where the young gentleman be make for. <just|hardly> <open|give> the door of the different room up-stair, look around for fleming, and if any one <notice|observation> you, ask if al hunter be there. that will let you out."  he leave me <then|so>, and after wait perhaps a minute, i <go|get> up-stair alone. the second floor be the ordinary upper story of a small dwell house. the door be close, but loud talk, smoke, and the rattle of <chip|scrap> float out through open transom. from below the noise of the piano come up the staircase, unmelodious but rhythmical, and from the street on which the house face an automobile be start it engine, with a series of <shoot|charge>-like explosion.  the noise be confuse, disconcert. <i|single> open two <door|threshold>, to find only the usual poker table, with the winner sit quietly, their card <bunch|bundle> in the palm of their hand, and the loser, grow more voluble a the night <go|fling> on, buy chip recklessly, drink more than they should. the atmosphere <be|follow> reek with smoke.  the third door i <open|give> be that of a dingy bath-room, with a <zinc|atomic_number_30> tub and a slovenly wash-stand. the next, however, be different. the light stream out through the transom a in the other room, but there be no noise from within. with my hand on the door, i hesitate--then, with hunter's injunction ring in my ear, i open it and look in.  a breath of cool night air from an open window <meet|touch> me. there be no <noise|resound>, no smoke, no sour odor of stale beer. a table have be draw to the center of the small room, and be litter with paper, pen and ink. at one corner be a tray, contain the remnant of a meal; a pillow and a pair of blanket <on|along> a couch at one side show the room have be serve a a <bedchamber|bedroom>.  but none of these thing catch my eye at first. at the table, lean forward, his head on his arm, be a man. i cough, and receive no answer, step into the room.  "i beg your pardon," i say, "but i <be|follow> look, for--"  then the truth burst on me, overwhelm me. a thin stream be spread over the <paper|newspaper> on the table, move slowly, sluggishly, a be the way with blood when the heart pump <be|follow> stop. i hurry over and raise the heavy, wobble, gray head. it be allan fleming and he have be shoot through the forehead.      my first impulse be to rouse the house; my second, to wait for hunter. to turn loose that <mob|ring> of half-drunken men in such a place seem profanation. there be <nothing|cipher> of the majesty or panoply of death here, but the very sordidness of the <surround|border> make me resolve to guard the new dignity of that figure. i be shock, of course; it would be absurd to say that i be emotionally unstring. on the contrary, i be conscious of a distinct feel of disappointment. fleming have be our key to the bellwood <affair|occasion>, and he <have|give> put himself beyond help to solve any mystery. i lock the door and stand wonder what to <do|come> next. i should <have|get> call a doctor, no doubt, but i have <see|ensure> enough of death to know that the <man|piece> be beyond aid of any kind.  it be not until i have bolt the door that i discover the absence of any weapon. everything that have go before <have|get> point to a position so untenable that suicide seem it natural and inevitable result. with the discovery that there be no revolver <on|along> the table or floor, the thing be more ominous. i decide at once to call the young <city|metropolis> physician in the room across the hall, and with something approximate panic, i throw open the <door|doorway>--to face harry wardrop, and behind him, hunter.  i do not remember that any one speak. hunter jump past me into the room and take in in a single glance what i have <labor|trade_union_movement> to acquire in three minute. a wardrop <come|occur> in, hunter lock the door behind him, and we three stand star at the prostrate figure over the table.  i watch wardrop: i have never see so suddenly abject a picture. he drop into a <chair|chairman>, and feel for his handkerchief, wipe his <shake|shiver> lip; every particle of color leave his <face|brass>, and he be <limp|hobble>, unnerve.  "do you hear the shoot?" hunter ask me. "it have be a matter of minute since it happen."  "i don't know," i say, <bewilder|vex>. "i hear a lot of explosion, but i think it be an automobile, out in the street."  hunter be listen while he examine the <room|board>, peer under the table, lift the blanket that have trail off the couch on to the floor. some one outside try the door-<knob|boss>, and find the door lock, shake it slightly.  "fleming!" he call under his breath. "fleming!"  we be silent, in response to a signal from hunter, and the <step|footfall> retreat heavily down the hall. the detective spread the blanket decently over the couch, and the three of u move the body there. wardrop be almost collapse.  "<now|immediately>," hunter say quietly, "before i call in <doctor|medico> gray from the room across, what do you know about this thing, mr. wardrop?"  wardrop look daze.  "he be in a bad way when i <leave|allow> this morning," he say huskily. "there isn't much use now try to hide anything; <god|immortal> know i've do all i could. but he have be use cocaine for <year|class>, and to-day he run out of the stuff. when i get here, about half an hour ago, he be on the <verge|wand> of kill himself. i get the revolver from him--he <be|follow> like a crazy <man|piece>, and a soon a i <dare|defy> to <leave|allow> him, i go out to try and find a <doctor|restore>--"  "to get some cocaine?"  "yes."  "not--because he be already wound, and you be afraid it be fatal?"  wardrop shudder; then he pull himself together, and his <tone|timber> be more natural.  "what's the use of lie about it?" he say wearily. "you won't <believe|consider> me if i tell the truth, either, but--he be dead when i get here. i hear something like the bang of a door a i go up-stair, but the noise be terrific down below, and i couldn't tell. when i go in, he be <just|hardly> drop forward, and--" he hesitate.  "the revolver?" hunter <query|question>, lynx-eye.  "be in his hand. he <be|follow> dead then."  "where be the revolver?"  "i will turn it over to the coroner."  "you will give it to me," hunter reply sharply. and after a little fumble, wardrop produce it from his hip pocket. it be an ordinary thirty-eight. the detective open it and glance at it. two <chamber|bedroom> be empty.  "and you wait--say ten minute, before you call for help, and even then you <go|run> <outside|international> hunt a doctor! what be you do in those ten minute?"  wardrop shut his lip and <refuse|defy> to reply.  "if mr. fleming shoot himself," the detective pursue relentlessly, "there would be powder mark around the wind. <then|so>, too, he be in the act of write a letter. it be a strange impulse, this--you <see|consider>, he have only <write|save> a dozen <word|countersign>."  i glance at the paper on the table. the letter have no superscription; it begin abruptly:       "i shall have to leave here. the number have follow me.      to-night--"  that be all.  "this be not suicide," hunter say gravely. "it be murder, and i warn you, mr. wardrop, to be careful what you say. will you ask doctor gray to come in, mr. knox?"  i <go|fling> across the hall to the room where the <noise|resound> be loudest. fortunately, doctor gray be out of the game. he be open a can of caviar at a table in the corner and come out in response to a gesture. he do not ask any question, and i let him go into the death chamber unprepared. the presence of death <apparently|obviously> have no effect on him, but the identity of the dead man almost stupefy him.  "fleming!" he say, awe, a he look down at the body. "fleming, by all that's sacred! and a suicide!"  hunter watch him grimly.  "how long have he be dead?" he ask.  the doctor glance at the bullet wind in the forehead, and from there significantly to the group <around|about> the couch.  "not an hour--probably le than half," he say. "it's strange we hear nothing, across the hall there."  hunter take a clean fold handkerchief from his pocket and open it <lay|repose> it gently over the dead face. i think it be a relief to all of u. the doctor get up from his kneel <posture|attitude> beside the <couch|sofa>, and look at hunter inquiringly.  "what <about|near> get him away from here?" he say. "there be <sure|certain> to be a lot of noise about it, and--you remember what happen when butler kill himself here."  "he be report a be find dead in the lumber yard," hunter say <dryly|drily>. "<well|easily>, doctor, this <body|trunk> stay where it be, and i don't give a whoop if the whole city government want it move. it won't be. this <be|follow> murder, not suicide."  the doctor's expression be curious.  "murder!" he repeat. "why--who--"  but hunter have many thing to attend to; he break in ruthlessly on the doctor's amazement.  "see if you can <get|take> the house empty, doctor; just tell them he be dead--the story will get out soon enough."  a the doctor leave the room hunter go to the open window, through which a fresh burst of rain be come, and close it. the window give me an idea, and <i|single> go over and try to see through the stream pane. there be no shed or low build outside, but not five yard away the warehouse <show|display> it ugly wall and <break|develop> window.  "look here, hunter," i say, "why could he not have be shoot from the warehouse?"  "he could have be--but he wasn't," hunter affirm, glance at wardrop's droop figure. "mr. wardrop, i be go to send for the coroner, and then i shall <ask|take> you to <go|run> with me to the office and <tell|say> the chief what you know about this. knox, will you <telephone|call> to the coroner?"  in an incredibly short time the club-house be empty, and before midnight the coroner himself arrive and <go|run> up to the room. a for me, i have breakfast, lunch and din on horror, and i sit in the desert room down-stair and try to think how i be to take the news to margery.  at twelve-thirty wardrop, hunter and the coroner come down-stair, leave a <detective|investigator> in charge of the body until <morning|daybreak>, when it could be take home. the coroner have a cab wait, and he take u at once to hunter's chief. he have not go to <bed|layer>, and we file into his library sepulchrally.  wardrop <tell|say> his story, but it be hardly convince. the chief, a <large|big> <man|piece> who say very little, and lean back with his eye partly shut, <listen|mind> in silence, only occasionally ask a question. the coroner, who be yawn steadily, leave in the middle of wardrop's story, a if in his mind, at least, the guilty man be a good a <hang|flow>.  "i be--i be--mr. allan fleming's private secretary," wardrop <begin|get>. "i <secure|ensure> the position through a relationship on his wife's side. i have hold the position for three year. before that i <read|say> law. for some time i have <know|recognize> that mr. fleming use a drug of some kind. until a week ago i do not know what it be. <on|along> the ninth of may, mr. fleming send for me. i be in plattsburg at the time, and he be at home. he be in a terrible condition--not sleep at all, and he say he be be <follow|succeed> by some person who mean to kill him. finally he ask me to get him some cocaine, and when he have take it he be more like himself.
