The _Lusitania_ have be <strike|take> by two torpedo in succession and be <sink|settle> rapidly, while the boat be be launch with all possible speed. The woman and child be be line up await their turn. Some still cling desperately to husband and father; others clutch their <child|youngster> closely to their breast. One girl stand alone, slightly apart from the rest. She be quite young, not more than eighteen. She do not seem afraid, and her grave, steadfast eye look straight <ahead|forward>. "I beg your pardon." A man's voice beside her make her start and turn. She <have|take> notice the speaker more than once amongst the <first|low>-class passenger. There have be a <hint|tinge> of mystery about him which have <appeal|attract> to her <imagination|vision>. He speak to no one. If anyone speak to him he be quick to rebuff the overture. Also he have a nervous way of <look|front> over his shoulder with a swift, suspicious glance. She notice <now|directly> that he be greatly agitate. There be bead of perspiration on his brow. He be evidently in a <state|nation> of overmaster fear. And yet he do not strike her a the kind of man who would <be|follow> afraid to meet death! "Yes?" Her grave eye meet his inquiringly. He stand <look|calculate> at her with a kind of desperate irresolution. "It must be!" he mutter to himself. "Yes--it be the <only|solitary> way." Then aloud he say abruptly: "You be an American?" "Yes." "A patriotic one?" The girl flush. "I guess you've no right to ask such a thing! Of course I be!" "Don't be offend. You wouldn't <be|follow> if you know how much there be at <stake|game>. But I've get to trust some one--and it must be a woman." "Why?" "Because of 'woman and <child|youngster> first.'" He look round and lower his voice. "I'm carry paper--vitally <important|significant> paper. They may make all the <difference|departure> to the Ally in the war. You understand? These paper <have|give> _<get|take>_ to be save! They've more chance with you than with me. Will you take them?" The girl hold out her hand. "<wait|await>--I must warn you. There may be a <risk|adventure>--if I've be follow. I don't think I have, but one never know. If so, there will be danger. Have you the nerve to <go|get> through with it?" The girl smile. "I'll go through with it all right. And I'm real proud to be choose! What be I to do with them afterwards?" "Watch the newspaper! I'll advertise in the personal column of the _Time_, begin 'Shipmate.' At the end of three day if there's nothing--well, you'll know I'm down and out. Then take the <packet|parcel> to the American Embassy, and <deliver|save> it into the Ambassador's own hand. Be that clear?" "Quite clear." "Then <be|follow> ready--I'm go to say <good|effective>-bye." He <take|acquire> her hand in his. "Good-bye. <good|honorable> luck to you," he say in a <louder|forte> tone. Her hand close on the oilskin packet that have lie in his palm. The _Lusitania_ <settle|determine> with a more decide list to starboard. In answer to a quick command, the girl go forward to take her <place|spot> in the boat. "TOMMY, old thing!" "Tuppence, old bean!" The two young people greet each other <affectionately|dearly>, and momentarily block the Dover Street Tube exit in do so. The adjective "old" be mislead. Their unite age would certainly not have total forty-five. "Not see you for <simply|just> century," continue the young man. "Where <be|follow> you off to? Come and chew a bun with me. We're get a bite unpopular here--block the gangway a it be. Let's get out of it." The girl assent, they <start|get> walk down Dover Street towards Piccadilly. "<now|directly> then," say Tommy, "where shall we go?" The very faint anxiety which underlay his tone <do|come> not escape the astute ear of Miss Prudence Cowley, know to her intimate friend for some <mysterious|inscrutable> reason a "Tuppence." She pounce at once. "Tommy, you're <stony|rocky>!" "Not a bite of it," declare Tommy unconvincingly. "Roll in cash." "You always be a shock liar," say Tuppence severely, "though you do once persuade Sister Greenbank that the <doctor|repair> have order you beer a a tonic, but forget to write it on the chart. Do you remember?" Tommy chuckle. "I should think I do! Wasn't the old cat in a rage when she find out? Not that she be a bad <sort|form> really, <old|former> Mother Greenbank! Good old hospital--demob like everything else, I suppose?" Tuppence sigh. "Yes. You too?" Tommy nod. "Two month ago." "Gratuity?" hint Tuppence. "Spend." "Oh, Tommy!" "No, old thing, not in riotous dissipation. No such luck! The cost of live--ordinary plain, or garden live nowadays be, I assure you, if you do not know----" "My dear child," interrupt Tuppence, "there be nothing I do _not_ know about the cost of live. Here we be at Lyons', and we <will|leave> each of u pay for our own. That's it!" And Tuppence lead the <way|agency> upstairs. The place be full, and they wander about look for a table, catch odds and end of conversation a they do so. "And--do you know, she sit down and _<cry|squall>_ when I tell her she couldn't have the flat after all." "It be simply a _bargain_, my dear! Just like the one Mabel Lewis bring from Paris----" "Funny <scrap|combat> one do overhear," murmur Tommy. "I pas two Johnny in the street to-day talk about some one call Jane Finn. Do you ever hear such a <name|mention>?" But at that moment two <elderly|senior> lady rise and collect parcel, and Tuppence deftly ensconce herself in one of the vacant seat. Tommy order tea and bun. Tuppence order tea and butter toast. "And mind the tea come in separate teapot," she add severely. Tommy sit down opposite her. His bar head reveal a <shock|outrage> of exquisitely slick-back red <hair|whisker>. His face be pleasantly ugly--nondescript, <yet|even> unmistakably the face of a gentleman and a sportsman. His brown suit <be|follow> well cut, but perilously <near|about> the <end|conclusion> of it tether. They be an essentially modern-look couple a they sit there. <tuppence|twopence> have no claim to beauty, but there be <character|eccentric> and charm in the <elfin|elvish> line of her little <face|look>, with it determine chin and large, wide-<apart|aside> grey <eye|centre> that look mistily out from under straight, black brow. She wear a small bright green toque over her black bob hair, and her extremely short and <rather|instead> shabby skirt reveal a pair of uncommonly dainty ankle. Her appearance present a <valiant|valorous> <attempt|essay> at smartness. The tea come at last, and Tuppence, rouse herself from a fit of meditation, pour it out. "<now|immediately> then," say Tommy, <take|assume> a large bite of bun, "let's get up-to-date. Remember, I haven't see you since that time in hospital in 1916." "<very|really> well." Tuppence help herself liberally to butter toast. "Abridge biography of Miss Prudence Cowley, fifth daughter of Archdeacon Cowley of <little|small> Missendell, Suffolk. <miss|girl> Cowley leave the delight (and drudgery) of her home life early in the war and come up to London, where she enter an officers' hospital. <first|low> month: Wash up six hundred and forty-eight plat every day. Second month: Promote to dry aforesaid plat. Third month: Promote to peel potato. Fourth month: <promote|raise> to <cut|swing> bread and butter. Fifth month: <promote|advertize> one floor up to duty of wardmaid with mop and pail. Sixth month: Promote to wait at table. Seventh month: Please appearance and nice manner so strike that be <promote|advertize> to wait on the Sister! Eighth month: Slight check in career. Sister Bond eat Sister Westhaven's egg! Grand row! Wardmaid clearly to blame! Inattention in such <important|significant> matter cannot be too highly censure. Mop and pail again! How be the mighty <fall|dusk>! <ninth|one-ninth> month: <promote|elevate> to sweep out ward, where I find a friend of my childhood in Lieutenant Thomas Beresford (bow, Tommy! ), whom I have not see for five long year. The meet be affect! Tenth month: Reprove by matron for visit the picture in company with one of the patient, namely: the aforementioned Lieutenant Thomas Beresford. Eleventh and twelfth month: Parlourmaid duty <resume|survey> with entire success. At the <end|stop> of the year leave hospital in a blaze of glory. After that, the talented Miss Cowley drive successively a trade delivery van, a motor-lorry and a general! The last be the pleasantest. He be <quite|rather> a young general!" "What blighter be that?" inquire Tommy. "Perfectly sicken the way those brass hat drive from the War Office to the _Savoy_, and from the _Savoy_ to the War Office!" "I've forget his name now," confess Tuppence. "To resume, that be in a way the apex of my career. I next enter a Government office. We have several very enjoyable tea party. I <have|make> intend to become a <land|realm> girl, a postwoman, and a <bus|busbar> conductress by way of round off my career--but the Armistice intervene! I cling to the <office|post> with the true limpet touch for many long month, but, ala, I be <comb|combing> out at last. Since then I've be look for a job. Now then--your turn." "There's not so much promotion in mine," say Tommy regretfully, "and a great deal le variety. I <go|get> out to France again, a you know. Then they send me to Mesopotamia, and I get wound for the second time, and go into hospital out there. Then I get stick in Egypt till the Armistice happen, kick my heel there some time <longer|tenacious>, and, a I tell you, finally get demob. And, for ten long, weary month I've be job hunt! There aren't any job! And, if there be, they wouldn't give 'em to me. What good be I? What do I know about business? Nothing." Tuppence nod gloomily. "What about the colony?" she suggest. Tommy shake his head. "I shouldn't like the <colony|settlement>--and I'm perfectly certain they wouldn't like me!" "Rich relation?" Again Tommy shake his head. "Oh, Tommy, not even a great-aunt?" "I've get an old uncle who's more or le roll, but he's no good." "Why not?" "Want to adopt me once. I refuse." "I think I remember hear about it," say Tuppence slowly. "You refuse because of your mother----" Tommy flush. "Yes, it would have be a bite <rough|rocky> on the mater. A you know, I <be|follow> all she have. Old boy hat her--want to get me away from her. Just a bite of spite." "Your mother's dead, isn't she?" say Tuppence gently. Tommy nod. Tuppence's large grey eye look misty. "You're a good <sort|kind>, Tommy. I always know it." "Rot!" say Tommy hastily. "Well, that's my position. I'm just about desperate." "So be I! I've hang out a long a I could. I've tout round. I've answer advertisement. I've try every mortal bless thing. I've screw and save and pinch! But it's no good. I shall have to go home!" "Don't you want to?" "Of course I don't want to! What's the <good|ripe> of be sentimental? Father's a dear--I'm awfully fond of him--but you've no <idea|thought> how I worry him! He have that delightful early Victorian view that short skirt and smoke <be|follow> immoral. You can imagine what a thorn in the flesh I <be|follow> to him! He just heave a sigh of <relief|rest> when the war take me off. You see, there <be|follow> seven of u at home. It's awful! All housework and mothers' meet! I have always be the changeling. I don't want to go back, but--oh, Tommy, what else be there to do?" Tommy shake his head sadly. There be a silence, and then Tuppence burst out: "Money, money, money! I think about money morning, noon and night! I dare say it's mercenary of me, but there it be!" "Same here," agree Tommy with feel. "I've think over every <imaginable|conceivable> <way|fashion> of get it too," continue <tuppence|twopence>. "There be only three! To be leave it, to marry it, or to make it. First be rule out. I haven't get any rich elderly relative. Any relative I have be in home for <decay|crumble> gentlewoman! I always help <old|older> lady over cross, and pick up parcel for old gentleman, in case they should turn out to be eccentric millionaire. But not one of them have ever ask me my name--and quite a lot never say 'thank you.'" There be a <pause|hesitate>. "Of course," <resume|sketch> Tuppence, "marriage be my best chance. I make up my mind to marry money when I be quite young. Any think girl would! I'm not sentimental, you know." She pause. "Come now, you can't say I'm sentimental," she add sharply. "Certainly not," agree Tommy hastily. "No one would ever think of sentiment in connection with you." "That's not very polite," reply Tuppence. "But I dare say you mean it all right. Well, there it be! I'm ready and will--but I never meet any rich men! All the boy I know be about a hard up a I be." "What about the general?" inquire Tommy. "I fancy he keep a bicycle shop in time of peace," explain Tuppence. "No, there it be! Now _you_ could marry a rich girl." "I'm like you. I don't know any." "That doesn't matter. You can always get to know one. Now, if I see a <man|valet> in a fur coat come out of the _Ritz_ I can't rush up to him and say: 'Look here, you're rich. I'd like to know you.'" "Do you suggest that I should do that to a similarly garb female?" "Don't be silly. You tread on her foot, or pick up her handkerchief, or something like that. If she think you want to know her she's flatter, and will manage it for you somehow." "You overrate my manly charm," murmur Tommy. "On the other hand," proceed Tuppence, "my millionaire would probably run for his life! No--<marriage|union> be fraught with difficulty. Remain--to _make_ money!" "We've try that, and fail," Tommy remind her. "We've try all the orthodox way, yes. But suppose we try the unorthodox. Tommy, let's be adventurer!" "Certainly," reply Tommy cheerfully. "How do we begin?" "That's the difficulty. If we could make ourselves know, people might hire u to commit <crime|offence> for them." "Delightful," comment Tommy. "Especially come from a clergyman's daughter!" "The moral guilt," Tuppence point out, "would be theirs--not mine. You must <admit|take> that there's a difference between steal a diamond necklace for yourself and be hire to steal it." "There wouldn't be the least difference if you be catch!" "Perhaps not. But I shouldn't be catch. I'm <so|therefore> clever." "Modesty always be your beset <sin|blunder>," remark Tommy. "Don't rag. Look here, Tommy, shall we really? Shall we form a business partnership?" "Form a company for the steal of diamond necklace?" "That be only an illustration. Let's have a--what do you call it in book-keep?" "Don't know. Never do any." "I have--but I always get mix up, and use to put <credit|accredit> entry on the debit side, and vice versa--so they fire me out. Oh, I know--a joint venture! It strike me a such a romantic phrase to <come|get> across in the middle of musty old figure. It's <get|go> an Elizabethan flavour <about|near> it--make one think of galleon and doubloon. A joint venture!" "Trade under the name of the Young Adventurer, Ltd.? Be that your idea, Tuppence?" "It's all very well to laugh, but I feel there might be something in it." "How <do|make> you propose to get in touch with your would-<be|follow> employer?" "Advertisement," reply Tuppence promptly. "<have|let> you get a bite of paper and a pencil? Men usually seem to have. Just like we <have|give> hairpin and powder-puff." Tommy hand over a <rather|quite> shabby green notebook, and Tuppence begin write busily. "Shall we begin: 'Young <officer|policeman>, twice wound in the war----'" "Certainly not." "Oh, very <well|considerably>, my dear boy. But I can assure you that that sort of thing might touch the heart of an elderly spinster, and she might <adopt|take> you, and then there would be no need for you to be a young adventurer at all." "I don't want to be adopt." "I forget you have a prejudice against it. I be <only|alone> <rag|shred> you! The paper be full up to the brim with that type of thing. Now listen--how's this? 'two young adventurer for hire. Will to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must <be|follow> good.' (We might a well make that clear from the start.) Then we might add: 'No reasonable <offer|tender> refuse'--like flat and furniture." "I should think any offer we get in answer to that would be a pretty _un_reasonable one!" "Tommy! You're a genius! That's ever <so|then> much more chic. 'No unreasonable offer refuse--if pay be <good|honorable>.' How's that?" "I shouldn't mention <pay|devote> again. It look rather eager." "It couldn't <look|expect> a eager a I feel! But perhaps you be right. Now I'll <read|take> it straight through. 'two <young|new> adventurer for hire. Will to do anything, go anywhere. Pay must be good. No unreasonable offer refuse.' How would that strike you if you <read|take> it?" "It would strike me a either be a hoax, or else write by a lunatic." "It's not half so insane a a thing I read this morning begin 'Petunia' and sign 'Best Boy.'" She tear out the leaf and hand it to Tommy. "There you be. _Time_, I <think|believe>. Reply to Box <so|therefore>-and-so. I expect it will be about five shill. Here's half a crown for my share." Tommy be hold the paper thoughtfully. His face burn a deeper red. "Shall we really try it?" he say at last. "Shall we, Tuppence? Just for the fun of the thing?" "Tommy, you're a sport! I know you would be! Let's drink to success." She pour some cold dreg of tea into the two cup. "Here's to our joint <venture|embark>, and may it prosper!" "The Young <adventurer|explorer>, Ltd.!" respond Tommy. They put down the cup and laugh rather uncertainly. Tuppence rise. "I must <return|take> to my palatial suite at the hostel." "Perhaps it be time I stroll round to the _Ritz_," agree Tommy with a grin. "Where shall we meet? And when?" "Twelve o'clock to-morrow. Piccadilly Tube station. <will|leave> that suit you?" "My time be my own," reply Mr. Beresford magnificently. "So long, then." "Good-bye, old <thing|matter>." The two young people go off in opposite <direction|focus>. Tuppence's hostel be situate in what be charitably call Southern Belgravia. For reason of economy she do not take a bus. She be half-way across St. James's Park, when a man's voice behind her make her start. "Excuse me," it say. "But may I speak to you for a <moment|bit>?" TUPPENCE turn sharply, but the word hover on the tip of her tongue remain unspoken, for the man's appearance and manner do not bear out her first and most natural assumption. She hesitate. A if he read her thought, the <man|mankind> say quickly: "I can assure you I mean no disrespect." Tuppence believe him. Although she dislike and distrust him instinctively, she be incline to acquit him of the particular motive which she have at first attribute to him. She look him up and down. He be a big man, clean shave, with a heavy jowl. His eye be small and cunning, and shift their glance under her direct gaze. "Well, what <be|follow> it?" she ask. The man smile. "I happen to overhear part of your conversation with the young gentleman in Lyons'." "Well--what of it?" "Nothing--except that <I|SINGLE> think I may be of some use to you." Another inference force itself into Tuppence's mind: "You follow me here?" "I take that liberty." "And in what way do you think you could be of use to me?" The man take a card from his pocket and hand it to her with a bow. Tuppence take it and scrutinize it carefully. It bore the inscription, "Mr. Edward Whittington." Below the name be the <word|news> "Esthonia Glassware Co.," and the <address|treat> of a city office. Mr. Whittington speak again: "If you will call upon me to-morrow morning at eleven o'clock, I will lay the detail of my <proposition|proposal> before you." "At eleven o'clock?" say Tuppence doubtfully. "At eleven o'clock." Tuppence make up her <mind|intellect>. "Very <well|easily>. I'll be there." "Thank you. Good even." He raise his hat with a flourish, and walk away. Tuppence remain for some minute gaze after him. Then she give a curious <movement|crusade> of her shoulder, rather a a terrier shake himself. "The adventure have begin," she murmur to herself. "What do he want me to do, I wonder? There's something about you, Mr. Whittington, that I don't like at all. But, on the other hand, I'm not the least bite afraid of you. And a I've say before, and shall doubtless say again, little Tuppence can <look|see> after herself, thank you!" And with a short, sharp nod of her head she walk briskly onward. A a result of further meditation, however, she turn aside from the direct route and enter a post <office|situation>. There she ponder for some moment, a telegraph form in her hand. The think of a possible five shill spend unnecessarily spur I should suggest that we call upon him there a soon a possible. Shall we say after a bath and breakfast?" It <be|follow> arrange that Tuppence and Julius should return to the _Ritz_, and call for Sir Jam in the car. This <programme|plan> be faithfully carry out, and a little after eleven they draw up before the _Metropole_. They ask for Dr. Hall, and a page-boy go in search of him. In a few minute the little doctor come <hurry|rush> towards them. "Can you spare u a few minute, Dr. Hall?" say Sir Jam pleasantly. "Let me introduce you to Miss Cowley. Mr. Hersheimmer, I think, you already know." A quizzical gleam come into the doctor's eye a he shake hand with Julius. "Ah, yes, my young <friend|champion> of the tree episode! Ankle all right, eh?" "I guess it's cure owe to your skilful treatment, doc." "And the heart trouble? Ha ha!" "Still search," say Julius briefly. "To come to the point, can we have a word with you in <private|individual>?" ask Sir Jam. "Certainly. I think there be a room here where we shall be quite undisturbed." He lead the way, and the others follow him. They sit down, and the <doctor|physician> look inquiringly at Sir <jam|fix>. "Dr. Hall, I be very anxious to <find|get> a certain young lady for the purpose of obtain a statement from her. I have reason to believe that she have be at one time or another in your establishment at Bournemouth. I hope I <be|follow> transgress no professional etiquette in <question|head> you on the subject?" "I suppose it be a matter of testimony?" Sir <jam|fix> hesitate a moment, then he reply: "Yes." "I shall be please to give you <any|whatever> <information|data> in my power. What be the <young|new> lady's <name|key>? Mr. Hersheimmer ask me, I remember----" He half turn to Julius. "The name," say Sir Jam bluntly, "be really immaterial. She would be <almost|nearly> certainly send to you under an assume one. But I should like to know if you be acquaint with a Mr. Vandemeyer?" "Mr. Vandemeyer, of 20 South Audley Mansion? I know her slightly." "You be not aware of what have happen?" "What do you mean?" "You do not know that Mr. Vandemeyer be dead?" "Dear, <dear|heartfelt>, I have no idea of it! When do it <happen|find>?" "She take an overdose of chloral last night." "Purposely?" "Accidentally, it be believe. I should not like to say myself. Anyway, she be find dead this <morning|dawn>." "Very sad. A singularly handsome woman. I presume she be a friend of yours, since you be acquaint with all these detail." "I be acquaint with the detail because--well, it be I who find her dead." "Indeed," say the doctor, start. "Yes," say Sir Jam, and stroke his chin reflectively. "This be very <sad|deplorable> news, but you will <excuse|apologize> me if I say that I do not see how it bear on the subject of your inquiry?" "It bear on it in this way, be it not a fact that Mr. Vandemeyer commit a young relative of hers to your charge?" Julius lean forward eagerly. "That be the <case|character>," say the doctor quietly. "Under the name of----?" "Janet Vandemeyer. I understand her to be a niece of Mr. Vandemeyer's." "And she come to you?" "A far a I can remember in June or July of 1915." "<be|follow> she a mental case?" "She be perfectly sane, if that be what you mean. I understand from Mr. Vandemeyer that the <girl|miss> <have|give> be with her on the _Lusitania_ when that ill-fat <ship|embark> be sink, and <have|give> suffer a severe shock in consequence." "We're on the right track, I think?" Sir Jam look round. "A <I|SINGLE> say before, I'm a mutt!" return Julius. The doctor look at them all curiously. "You speak of want a statement from her," he say. "Suppose she <be|follow> not able to give one?" "What? You have just say that she be perfectly sane." "So she be. Nevertheless, if you want a statement from her concern any event prior to May 7, 1915, she will not be able to give it to you." They look at the <little|small> man, stupefy. He nod cheerfully. "It's a pity," he say. "A <great|large> pity, especially a I <gather|accumulate>, Sir Jam, that the matter <be|follow> important. But there it be, she can tell you nothing." "But why, man? Darn it all, why?" The little man shift his benevolent glance to the excite young American. "Because Janet Vandemeyer <be|follow> suffer from a complete loss of memory." _"What? "_ "Quite <so|then>. An <interest|concern> case, a _very_ interest case. Not so uncommon, really, a you would think. There be several very well <know|recognize> parallel. It's the first case of the kind that I've have under my own personal observation, and I must admit that I've find it of absorb <interest|pursuit>." There be something rather ghoulish in the little man's satisfaction. "And she remember nothing," say Sir Jam slowly. "Nothing prior to May 7, 1915. After that date her memory be a good a yours or mine." "Then the <first|low> thing she remember?" "Be land with the survivor. Everything before that be a blank. She <do|come> not know her own name, or where she have come from, or where she be. She couldn't even speak her own tongue." "But surely all this be most unusual?" put in Julius. "No, my dear sir. <quite|rather> normal under the circumstance. Severe shock to the nervous <system|arrangement>. Loss of memory proceed nearly always on the same line. I suggest a specialist, of course. There's a very good man in Paris--make a <study|report> of these <case|slip>--but Mr. Vandemeyer oppose the idea of <publicity|promotion> that might result from such a course." "I can imagine she would," say Sir Jam grimly. "I fell in with her view. There be a certain notoriety give to these <case|cause>. And the girl be very young--nineteen, I believe. It seem a pity that her <infirmity|feebleness> should be talk about--might damage her prospect. Besides, there <be|follow> no special treatment to <pursue|follow> in such case. It be really a matter of wait." "Wait?" "Yes, sooner or later, the memory will return--a suddenly a it go. But in all probability the girl will have entirely forget the intervene period, and will take up life where she leave off--at the sink of the _Lusitania_." "And when do you expect this to happen?" The doctor shrug his shoulder. "Ah, that I cannot say. Sometimes it be a matter of month, sometimes it <have|get> be know to <be|follow> a long a twenty year! Sometimes another shock do the <trick|illusion>. One restore what the other take away." "Another shock, eh?" say Julius thoughtfully. "Exactly. There be a case in Colorado----" The little man's voice <trail|tail> on, voluble, mildly enthusiastic. Julius do not seem to be listen. He have relapse into his own <thought|recollect> and <be|follow> frown. Suddenly he come out of his brown <study|learn>, and hit the table such a resound bang with his fist that every one jump, the doctor most of all. "I've get it! I guess, doc, I'd like your medical opinion on the plan I'm about to outline. Say Jane be to cross the herring pond again, and the same thing be to happen. The <submarine|bomber>, the sink ship, every one to take to the boat--and so on. Wouldn't that do the trick? Wouldn't it give a mighty big bump to her subconscious self, or whatever the jargon be, and start it function again right away?" "A very interest <speculation|hypothesis>, Mr. Hersheimmer. In my own opinion, it would be successful. It be unfortunate that there <be|follow> no chance of the condition repeat themselves a you suggest." "Not by nature, <perhaps|possibly>, doc. But I'm talk about art." "Art?" "Why, yes. What's the difficulty? Hire a liner----" "A liner!" murmur Dr. Hall faintly. "Hire some passenger, <hire|take> a submarine--that's the only difficulty, I guess. Government be apt to be a bite hide-bind over their engine of war. They won't sell to the first-comer. Still, I guess that can be get over. Ever hear of the word 'graft,' sir? Well, graft get there every time! I reckon that we shan't really need to fire a torpedo. If every one hustle round and scream loud enough that the ship be sink, it ought to be enough for an <innocent|unacquainted> young girl like Jane. By the time she's get a <life|biography>-belt on her, and be be <hustle|sting> into a boat, with a <well|swell>-drill lot of artiste do the hysterical stunt on deck, why--she ought to be <right|good> back where she be in May, 1915. How's that for the <bare|plain> outline?" Dr. Hall look at Julius. Everything that he be for the moment incapable of say be eloquent in that look. "No," say Julius, in answer to it, "I'm not crazy. The thing's perfectly possible. It's do every <day|daytime> in the <state|country> for the movie. Haven't you see train in collision on the screen? What's the difference between buy up a train and buy up a liner? Get the <property|place> and you can go right ahead!" Dr. Hall <find|see> his voice. "But the expense, my dear sir." His voice rise. "The expense! It <will|leave> be _colossal!_" "Money doesn't worry me any," explain Julius simply. Dr. Hall turn an appeal face to Sir Jam, who smile slightly. "Mr. Hersheimmer be very well off--very <well|easily> off indeed." The doctor's glance come back to Julius with a <new|young> and subtle quality in it. This be no longer an eccentric young fellow with a <habit|use> of fall off tree. The doctor's eye hold the deference accord to a really rich man. "Very <remarkable|noteworthy> <plan|contrive>. Very remarkable," he murmur. "The movie--of course! Your American word for the kinema. Very interest. I fear we be perhaps a little behind the time over here in our method. And you really mean to carry out this remarkable <plan|design> of yours." "You bet your bottom dollar I do." The doctor <believe|consider> him--which be a tribute to his nationality. If an Englishman have suggest such a <thing|matter>, he would have have grave doubt a to his sanity. "I cannot guarantee a cure," he <point|sharpen> out. "Perhaps I ought to make that quite clear." "Sure, that's all right," say Julius. "You <just|simply> trot out Jane, and <leave|allow> the rest to me." "Jane?" "Miss Janet Vandemeyer, then. Can we <get|acquire> on the long distance to your <place|rank> right away, and ask them to send her <up|astir>; or shall I run down and <fetch|get> her in my car?" The doctor star. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Hersheimmer. I <think|consider> you understand." "Understand what?" "That <miss|lose> Vandemeyer be no longer under my care." JULIUS spring up. "What?" "I think you be aware of that." "When do she leave?" "Let me <see|consider>. To-day be Monday, be it not? It must have be last Wednesday--why, surely--yes, it <be|follow> the same even that you--er--fell out of my tree." "That even? Before, or after?" "Let me see--oh yes, afterwards. A <very|really> urgent message arrive from Mr. Vandemeyer. The <young|new> lady and the nurse who be in charge of her <leave|lead> by the night train." Julius sink back again into his chair. "Nurse Edith--leave with a patient--I remember," he mutter. "My God, to have be so near!" Dr. Hall look <bewilder|pose>. "I don't understand. Be the young lady not with her aunt, after all?" <tuppence|twopence> shake her head. She be about to speak when a warn glance from Sir Jam make her <hold|appreciation> her tongue. The lawyer rise. "I'm much oblige to you, Hall. We're very grateful for all you've tell u. I'm afraid we're now in the position of have to track Miss Vandemeyer anew. What about the nurse who accompany her; I suppose you don't know where she be?" The doctor shake his head. "We've not hear from her, a it happen. I understand she be to remain with Miss Vandemeyer for a while. But what can <have|give> happen? Surely the girl <have|give> not be kidnap." "That remain to be see," say Sir Jam gravely. The other hesitate. "You <do|come> not think I ought to go to the police?" "No, no. In all probability the young lady be with other relation." The doctor be not completely satisfy, but he <saw|consider> that Sir Jam be determine to say no more, and realize that to try and extract more information from the famous K.C. would be mere <waste|consume> of labour. Accordingly, he wish them goodbye, and they leave the hotel. For a few minute they stand by the car talk. "How madden," cry Tuppence. "To think that Julius must have be actually under the same roof with her for a few <hour|minute>." "I be a darn idiot," mutter Julius gloomily. "You couldn't know," Tuppence console him. "Could he?" She appeal to Sir Jam. "I should advise you not to worry," say the latter kindly. "No use <cry|yell> over spill milk, you <know|recognize>." "The great thing be what to do next," add Tuppence the practical. Sir <jam|fix> shrug his shoulder. "You might advertise for the nurse who accompany the girl. That be the only course I can suggest, and I must confess I do not hope for much result. Otherwise there be nothing to be do." "Nothing?" say Tuppence blankly. "And--Tommy?" "We must hope for the best," say Sir Jam. "Oh yes, we must go on hop." But over her downcast <head|principal> his eye meet Julius's, and almost imperceptibly he shake his head. Julius understand. The lawyer <consider|see> the case hopeless. The young American's face grow grave. Sir Jam take Tuppence's hand. "You must let me know if anything further <come|fare> to <light|idle>. Letter will always be forward." Tuppence star at him blankly. "You be go away?" "I tell you. Don't you remember? To Scotland." "Yes, but I think----" The girl hesitate. Sir Jam shrug his shoulder. "My dear young lady, I can <do|make> <nothing|nil> more, I fear. Our clue have all end in thin air. You can take my word for it that there be <nothing|zero> more to be do. If anything should arise, I shall <be|follow> glad to advise you in <any|whatever> <way|room> I can." His word give Tuppence an extraordinarily desolate feel. "I suppose you're right," she say. "Anyway, thank you very much for try to help u. Good-bye." Julius be bend over the car. A momentary pity come into Sir James's keen eye, a he gaze into the girl's downcast face. "Don't be too disconsolate, Miss Tuppence," he say in a low voice. "Remember, holiday-time isn't always all playtime. One sometimes manage to put in some <work|sour> a <well|easily>." Something in his tone <make|get> Tuppence glance up sharply. He shake his <head|guide> with a smile. "No, I shan't say any more. Great mistake to say too much. Remember that. Never tell all you know--not <even|yet> to the person you know best. Understand? Good-bye." He stride away. Tuppence <star|genius> after him. She be <begin|get> to understand Sir James's method. Once before he have throw her a <hint|lead> in the same careless fashion. Be this a hint? What exactly lay behind those <last|live> brief <word|countersign>? Do he mean that, after all, he have not abandon the case; that, secretly, he would be work on it still while---- Her meditation be interrupt by Julius, who adjure her to "get right in." "You're look kind of thoughtful," he remark a they start off. "Do the old guy say anything more?" Tuppence open her mouth impulsively, and then shut it again. Sir James's word <sound|voice> in her ear: "Never <tell|say> all you know--not even to the person you know best." And like a flash there come into her mind another memory. Julius before the safe in the flat, her own question and the pause before his reply, "Nothing." Be there really nothing? Or have he find something he wish to keep to himself? If he could make a reservation, so could she. "Nothing particular," she reply. She felt rather than saw Julius throw a sideways glance at her. "Say, shall we go for a spin in the park?" "If you like." For a while they run on under the tree in silence. It be a beautiful day. The keen rush through the air bring a new exhilaration to Tuppence. "Say, Miss Tuppence, do you <think|believe> I'm <ever|always> go to find Jane?" Julius speak in a discourage voice. The mood be so alien to him that Tuppence turn and star at him in surprise. He nod. "That's <so|thus>. I'm <get|come> down and out over the business. Sir Jam to-day hadn't <get|take> any hope at all, I could see that. I don't like him--we don't gee together somehow--but he's <pretty|fairly> cute, and I guess he wouldn't quit if there be any chance of success--now, would he?" Tuppence felt rather uncomfortable, but cling to her belief that Julius also have withhold something from her, she remain firm. "He suggest advertise for the nurse," she remind him. "Yes, with a 'forlorn hope' flavour to his voice! No--I'm about feed up. I've half a mind to go back to the State <right|rectify> away." "Oh no!" cry <tuppence|twopence>. "We've get to find Tommy." "I sure forget Beresford," say Julius contritely. "That's so. We must find him. But after--well, I've be day-dream ever since I start on this <trip|slip>--and these dream be rotten poor business. I'm quit of them. Say, Miss Tuppence, there's something I'd like to ask you." "Yes?" "You and Beresford. What about it?" "I don't <understand|read> you," reply Tuppence with dignity, add rather inconsequently: "And, anyway, you're wrong!" "Not get a sort of kindly feel for one another?" "Certainly not," say Tuppence with warmth. "Tommy and I be friend--nothing more." "I guess every pair of <lover|buff> have say that sometime or another," observe Julius. "Nonsense!" snap Tuppence. "Do I look the sort of girl that's <always|incessantly> fall in love with every man she meet?" "You do not. You look the <sort|variety> of <girl|miss> that's mighty often get <fall|settle> in love with!" "Oh!" say Tuppence, <rather|instead> take aback. "That's a compliment, I suppose?" "Sure. Now let's get down to this. Suppose we never find Beresford and--and----" "All right--say it! I can face fact. Suppose he's--dead! Well?" "And all this business fiddle out. What be you <go|get> to do?" "I don't know," say Tuppence forlornly. "You'll be darn lonesome, you <poor|short> <kid|nestling>." "I shall be all right," snap Tuppence with her usual resentment of any kind of pity. "What <about|near> marriage?" inquire Julius. "Get <any|whatever> view on the subject?" "I intend to marry, of course," reply Tuppence. "That be, if"--she pause, know a momentary long to draw back, and then stick to her gun bravely--"I can find some one rich enough to make it worth my while. That's frank, isn't it? I dare say you despise me for it." "I never despise business instinct," say Julius. "What particular figure <have|give> you in mind?" "Figure?" ask Tuppence, <puzzle|beat>. "Do you mean tall or short?" "No. Sum--income." "Oh, I--I haven't quite work that out." "What about me?" _"You? "_ "Sure thing." "Oh, I couldn't!" "Why not?" "I tell you I couldn't." "Again, why not?" "It would seem so unfair." "I don't see anything unfair <about|around> it. I call your bluff, that's all. <I|SINGLE> admire you immensely, Miss <tuppence|twopence>, more than any girl I've ever meet. You're so darn plucky. I'd just love to give you a real, rattle good time. Say the word, and we'll <run|go> round right away to some high-class jeweller, and fix up the ring <business|concern>." "I can't," gasp Tuppence. "Because of Beresford?" "No, no, _no!_" "Well then?" Tuppence merely continue to shake her head violently. "You can't reasonably expect more dollar than I've get." "Oh, it isn't that," gasp Tuppence with an <almost|nearly> hysterical laugh. "But thank you very much, and all that, I <think|remember> I'd better say no." "I'd be oblige if you'd do me the favour to <think|believe> it over until to-morrow." "It's no use." "Still, I guess we'll leave it like that." "Very well," say Tuppence meekly. Neither of them speak again until they <reach|make> the _Ritz_. Tuppence go upstairs to her room. She felt morally batter to the grind after her conflict with Julius's vigorous personality. Sit down in <front|movement> of the glass, she star at her own reflection for some minute. "Fool," murmur Tuppence at length, make a <grimace|face>. "Little fool. Everything you want--everything you've ever hop for, and you go and bleat out 'no' like an idiotic little sheep. It's your one chance. Why don't you <take|acquire> it? Grab it? Snatch at it? What more do you want?" A if in answer to her own <question|wonder>, her eye fell on a small snapshot of Tommy that stand on her <dress|garment>-table in a shabby <frame|build>. For a moment she struggle for self-control, and then abandon all presence, she hold it to her lip and burst into a fit of sob. "Oh, Tommy, Tommy," she cry, "I <do|make> <love|know> you so--and I may never see you again...." At the end of five minute Tuppence He give her an emphatic little nod. "Quite right, Miss Tuppence. You scent danger. <so|then> do I. So do Miss Finn." "Yes," admit Jane. "It's absurd--but I can't help it." Sir Jam nod again. "You feel--a we all feel-- _the presence of Mr. Bown_. Yes"--a Tuppence make a movement--"not a doubt of it-- _Mr. Brown be here_...." "In this <house|home>?" "In this <room|board>.... You don't understand? _I be Mr. Brown_...." Stupefy, unbelieving, they star at him. The very line of his face have change. It be a different man who stand before them. He smile a slow <cruel|brutal> smile. "Neither of you <will|leave> leave this room alive! You say just <now|instantly> we have succeed. _I_ have succeed! The <draft|conscription> treaty be mine." His smile grow wider a he look at Tuppence. "Shall I tell you how it will <be|follow>? <sooner|earlier> or later the police will break in, and they will find three victim of Mr. Brown--three, not two, you understand, but fortunately the third will not be dead, only wound, and will be able to describe the attack with a wealth of <detail|item>! The treaty? It be in the hand of Mr. Brown. So no one will think of <search|look> the pocket of Sir Jam Peel Edgerton!" He turn to Jane. "You outwit me. I make my acknowledgment. But you will not do it again." There be a faint sound behind him, but, intoxicate with success, he do not turn his head. He slip his hand into his pocket. "Checkmate to the <young|new> Adventurer," he say, and slowly raise the big <automatic|reflexive>. But, even a he do so, he felt himself seize from behind in a grip of iron. The revolver be wrench from his hand, and the voice of Julius Hersheimmer say drawlingly: "I guess you're <catch|capture> redhanded with the good upon you." The blood rush to the K.C. 's face, but his self-control be marvellous, a he <look|reckon> from one to the other of his two captor. He look <longest|tenacious> at Tommy. "You," he say beneath his breath. "_You!_ I might <have|let> know." See that he be dispose to offer no resistance, their <grip|fascinate> slacken. Quick a a flash his leave hand, the hand which <bore|assume> the big signet ring, be raise to his lip.... "'_Ave, Caesar! te morituri salutant_,'" he say, still look at Tommy. Then his <face|present> <change|shift>, and with a long convulsive shudder he fell forward in a crumple heap, whilst an odour of bitter almond fill the air. THE supper party give by Mr. Julius Hersheimmer to a few friend on the even of the 30th will long be remember in cater circle. It take <place|put> in a private room, and Mr. Hersheimmer's <order|arrange> be brief and forcible. He give carte blanche--and when a millionaire give carte blanche he usually get it! Every delicacy out of season be duly provide. Waiter carry bottle of ancient and royal vintage with love care. The floral decoration defy the <season|temper>, and <fruit|yield> of the <earth|globe> a far apart a May and November find themselves miraculously side by side. The list of guest be small and select. The American Ambassador, Mr. Carter, who have <take|have> the liberty, he say, of bring an <old|former> friend, Sir William Beresford, with him, Archdeacon Cowley, Dr. Hall, those two youthful adventurer, Miss Prudence Cowley and Mr. Thomas Beresford, and <last|live>, but not least, a guest of honour, Miss Jane Finn. Julius have spar no pain to make Jane's appearance a success. A mysterious knock have bring Tuppence to the <door|doorway> of the apartment she be share with the American <girl|daughter>. It be Julius. In his <hand|reach> he hold a cheque. "<say|order>, <tuppence|twopence>," he begin, "will you <do|come> me a good turn? Take this, and get Jane regularly tog up for this even. You're all come to supper with me at the _Savoy_. See? Spare no expense. You get me?" "Sure thing," mimic Tuppence. "We shall enjoy ourselves. It will be a <pleasure|delight> dress Jane. She's the <loveliest|adorable> thing I've ever <see|ensure>." "That's so," agree Mr. Hersheimmer fervently. His fervour bring a momentary <twinkle|light> to Tuppence's eye. "By the <way|style>, Julius," she remark demurely, "I--haven't give you my answer <yet|however>." "Answer?" say Julius. His face pal. "You know--when you ask me to--marry you," falter Tuppence, her eye downcast in the true manner of the early Victorian heroine, "and wouldn't take no for an answer. I've <think|remember> it <well|considerably> over----" "Yes?" say Julius. The perspiration stand on his forehead. <tuppence|twopence> relent suddenly. "You great idiot!" she say. "What on earth <induce|cause> you to <do|come> it? I could see at the time you didn't care a twopenny dip for me!" "Not at all. I have--and still have--the highest sentiment of esteem and <respect|value>--and admiration for you----" "H'm!" say Tuppence. "Those be the <kind|sort> of sentiment that very soon go to the wall when the other <sentiment|persuasion> come along! Don't they, old thing?" "I don't know what you mean," say Julius stiffly, but a large and burn <blush|flush> overspread his countenance. "Shuck!" retort Tuppence. She laugh, and close the door, reopen it to add with dignity: "Morally, I shall <always|constantly> consider I have be jilt!" "What be it?" ask Jane a Tuppence rejoin her. "Julius." "What do he want?" "Really, I <think|remember>, he want to see you, but I wasn't go to let him. Not until to-night, when you're go to burst upon every one like King Solomon in his glory! <come|follow> on! _We're go to shop!_" To most people the 29th, the <much|often>-herald "Labour Day," have pas <much|often> a any other day. <speech|address> be make in the Park and Trafalgar Square. Straggle procession, sing the _Red Flag_, wander through the street in a more or le aimless manner. Newspaper which have hint at a general strike, and the inauguration of a reign of <terror|threat>, be force to hide their diminish head. The <bolder|sheer> and more astute among them seek to prove that peace have be effect by follow their counsel. In the Sunday paper a brief notice of the sudden death of Sir Jam Peel Edgerton, the <famous|notable> K.<C|SNOW>., <have|take> appear. Monday's paper deal appreciatively with the dead man's career. The exact manner of his sudden death be never make public. Tommy have be right in his forecast of the situation. It have be a one-man <show|read>. Deprive of their chief, the organization fell to piece. Kramenin have make a precipitate return to Russia, leave England early on Sunday morning. The gang have flee from Astley Prior in a panic, <leave|provide> behind, in their haste, various damage document which compromise them hopelessly. With these proof of conspiracy in their hand, aid further by a small brown diary take from the pocket of the dead man which <have|get> contain a full and damn resume of the whole plot, the <government|administration> have call an eleventh-hour conference. The Labour leader be force to recognize that they have be use a a cat's paw. Certain concession be make by the Government, and <be|follow> eagerly accept. It be to be Peace, not War! But the Cabinet know by how narrow a <margin|border> they have escape utter disaster. And burn in on Mr. Carter's brain be the strange scene which have take place in the house in Soho the <night|dark> before. He have enter the squalid room to <find|obtain> that great man, the friend of a lifetime, dead--betray out of his own <mouth|lip>. From the dead man's pocket-<book|script> he have retrieve the ill-omen draft <treaty|accord>, and then and there, in the presence of the other three, it have be reduce to ash.... England be save! And now, on the even of the 30th, in a private room at the _Savoy_, Mr. Julius P. Hersheimmer be receive his guest. Mr. Carter be the first to arrive. With him be a choleric-look old gentleman, at sight of whom Tommy flush up to the <root|ancestor> of his hair. He come forward. "Ha!" say the old gentleman, survey him apoplectically. "<so|therefore> you're my nephew, be you? Not much to look at--but you've do <good|estimable> <work|solve>, it seem. Your mother must <have|let> bring you up well after all. Shall we let bygone be bygone, eh? You're my <heir|successor>, you know; and in future I propose to <make|realize> you an allowance--and you can look upon Chalmers Park a your home." "Thank you, sir, it's awfully <decent|right> of you." "Where's this young lady I've be hear such a <lot|heap> about?" Tommy introduce Tuppence. "Ha!" say Sir William, eye her. "Girl aren't what they <use|apply> to be in my young day." "Yes, they be," say Tuppence. "Their <clothe|dress> be different, perhaps, but they themselves be <just|simply> the same." "Well, perhaps you're right. Minx then--minx now!" "That's it," say Tuppence. "I'm a frightful minx myself." "I believe you," say the old gentleman, chuckle, and pinch her ear in high good-<humour|mood>. Most young woman be terrify of the "old bear," a they term him. Tuppence's pertness delight the old misogynist. Then come the <timid|cautious> archdeacon, a <little|short> bewilder by the <company|caller> in which he find himself, glad that his daughter be consider to have distinguish herself, but unable to help glance at her from time to time with nervous apprehension. But Tuppence behave admirably. She forbear to cross her leg, set a guard upon her <tongue|knife>, and steadfastly refuse to smoke. Dr. Hall <come|get> next, and he be follow by the American Ambassador. "We might a well sit down," say Julius, when he have introduce all his guest to each other. "Tuppence, will you----" He indicate the place of <honour|observe> with a wave of his hand. But Tuppence shake her head. "No--that's Jane's place! When one think of how she's <hold|apply> out all these year, she ought to be make the queen of the feast to-night." Julius fling her a grateful glance, and Jane come forward shyly to the allot seat. Beautiful a she <have|take> seem before, it be a nothing to the loveliness that now go fully adorn. Tuppence have perform her part faithfully. The model gown supply by a famous dressmaker have be entitle "A tiger lily." It be all gold and red and brown, and out of it rise the pure column of the girl's white throat, and the bronze <mass|bulk> of <hair|whisker> that crown her lovely head. There be admiration in every eye, a she take her seat. Soon the supper party be in full swing, and with one accord Tommy be call upon for a full and complete <explanation|account>. "You've <be|follow> too darn close <about|near> the whole business," Julius accuse him. "You let on to me that you be off to the Argentine--though I guess you have your reason for that. The idea of both you and Tuppence cast me for the part of Mr. Brown just tickle me to death!" "The idea be not original to them," say Mr. Carter gravely. "It be suggest, and the poison very carefully instill, by a past-<master|chief> in the art. The paragraph in the New York paper suggest the plan to him, and by <mean|signify> of it he weave a web that nearly enmesh you fatally." "I never like him," say Julius. "I felt from the first that there be something wrong about him, and I always suspect that it be he who silence Mr. Vandemeyer so appositely. But it wasn't till <I|SINGLE> hear that the order for Tommy's execution <come|do> right on the <heel|list> of our interview with him that Sunday that I begin to tumble to the fact that he be the big bug himself." "I never suspect it at all," lament Tuppence. "I've always think I <be|follow> <so|indeed> much <cleverer|ingenious> than Tommy--but he's undoubtedly score over me handsomely." Julius agree. "Tommy's be the <good|effective> this trip! And, instead of sit there a dumb a a fish, let him banish his blush, and tell u all about it." "Hear! hear!" "There's nothing to tell," say Tommy, acutely uncomfortable. "I be an awful mug--right up to the time I find that photograph of Annette, and realize that she be Jane Finn. Then I remember how persistently she have shout out that word 'Marguerite'--and I think of the picture, and--well, that's that. <then|so> of course I go over the <whole|solid> thing to see where I'd make an as of myself." "Go on," say Mr. Carter, a Tommy show sign of <take|admit> refuge in silence once more. "That business about Mr. Vandemeyer <have|make> worry me when Julius tell me about it. On the face of it, it seem that he or Sir Jam must have do the trick. But I didn't know which. Find that photograph in the drawer, after that story of how it have be <get|find> from him by Inspector Brown, make me suspect Julius. Then I remember that it be Sir Jam who <have|get> discover the false Jane Finn. In the <end|cease>, I couldn't make up my mind--and just <decide|settle> to take no chance either way. I <leave|will> a note for Julius, in <case|caseful> he be Mr. Brown, say I be off to the Argentine, and I <drop|throw> Sir James's letter with the offer of the job by the desk so that he would see it be a genuine stunt. Then I write my letter to Mr. Carter and ring up Sir Jam. Take him into my confidence would be the best thing either way, so I tell him everything except where I believe the paper to <be|follow> hide. The <way|fashion> he help me to <get|acquire> on the track of Tuppence and Annette almost disarm me, but not quite. I keep my mind open between the two of them. And <then|so> I get a bogus note from Tuppence--and I know!" "But how?" Tommy <take|remove> the note in question from his pocket and pas it round the table. "It's her handwrite all right, but I know it wasn't from her because of the signature. She'd never spell her name 'twopence,' but anyone who'd never see it write might quite easily do so. Julius _have_ <see|ensure> it--he <show|establish> me a <note|observe> of hers to him once--but _Sir <jam|pile> hadn't!_ After that everything be plain sail. I send off Albert post-haste to Mr. Carter. I pretend to go away, but <double|treble> back again. When Julius come <burst|break> up in his car, I felt it wasn't <part|role> of Mr. Brown's plan--and that there would probably be trouble. Unless Sir Jam be actually catch in the act, so to speak, I know Mr. Carter would never believe it of him on my bare <word|discussion>----" "I didn't," interpose Mr. Carter ruefully. "That's why I send the girl off to Sir Jam. I <be|follow> <sure|certain> they'd fetch up at the house in Soho sooner or later. I threaten Julius with the revolver, because I want Tuppence to repeat that to Sir Jam, so that he wouldn't worry about u. The moment the girl be out of sight I tell Julius to drive like hell for London, and a we go along I tell him the whole <story|level>. We get to the Soho house in plenty of time and meet Mr. Carter outside. After arrange thing with him we go in and hide behind the curtain in the recess. The policeman <have|take> order to say, if they be ask, that no one <have|let> <go|run> into the house. That's all." And Tommy come to an <abrupt|precipitous> halt. There be silence for a moment. "By the way," say Julius suddenly, "you're all wrong about that photograph of Jane. It _be_ take from me, but <I|SINGLE> find it again." "Where?" cry Tuppence. "In that little safe on the wall in Mr. Vandemeyer's bedroom." "I know you <find|obtain> something," say Tuppence reproachfully. "To tell you the <truth|accuracy>, that's what start me off suspect you. Why didn't you say?" "I guess I be a mite suspicious too. It <have|let> be get away from me <once|formerly>, and I <determine|shape> I wouldn't let on I'd get it until a photographer have make a dozen copy of it!" "We all keep back something or other," say Tuppence thoughtfully. "I suppose secret service work make you like that!" In the pause that ensue, Mr. Carter take from his <pocket|sack> a small shabby brown book. "Beresford have just say that I would not <have|let> believe Sir Jam Peel Edgerton to be guilty unless, so to speak, he be catch in the act. That be so. Indeed, not until <I|SINGLE> read the entry in this little book could I <bring|take> myself fully to credit the amaze truth. This book will pas into the possession of Scotland Yard, but it will never be publicly exhibit. Sir James's <long|tenacious> association with the <law|police> would make it undesirable. But to you, who <know|recognize> the truth, I propose to read certain passage which <will|leave> throw some light on the extraordinary mentality of this great man." He open the book, and turn the thin page. "... It be madness to <keep|save> this <book|reserve>. I <know|recognize> that. It <be|follow> documentary evidence against me. But I have never shrink from <take|yield> risk. And I <feel|find> an urgent <need|motive> for self-expression.... The book will only be take from my dead <body|trunk>.... "... From an early age I realize that I have exceptional ability. Only a fool underestimate his <capability|capableness>. My <brain|genius> power be greatly above the average. I <know|recognize> that <I|SINGLE> be bear to succeed. My appearance be the only thing against me. I be quiet and insignificant--utterly nondescript.... "... When I be a boy I hear a famous murder <trial|test>. I be deeply impress by the power and eloquence of the counsel for the defence. For the <first|low> time I entertain the idea of <take|consider> my talent to that particular market.... Then I study the criminal in the dock.... The man be a fool--he have be incredibly, unbelievably stupid. <even|yet> the eloquence of his counsel be <hardly|scarcely> <likely|probable> to save him. I felt an immeasurable contempt for him.... Then it occur to me that the criminal standard be a low one. It be the wastrel, the failure, the general riff-raff of civilization who drift into crime.... Strange that men of <brain|wit> have never realize it extraordinary opportunity.... I play with the <idea|estimate>.... What a magnificent field--what unlimited possibility! It make my brain reel.... "... I read standard work on crime and criminal. They all confirm my opinion. Degeneracy, disease--never the deliberate <embrace|adopt> of a career by a far-see man. Then I consider. Suppose my utmost ambition be <realize|see>--that <I|SINGLE> be call to the bar, and rise to the height of my profession? That I enter politics--say, even, that I become Prime Minister of England? What then? Be that power? Hamper at every <turn|grow> by my colleague, fetter by the democratic system of which I should be the mere figurehead! No--the power <I|SINGLE> dream of be absolute! An autocrat! A dictator! And such power could <only|simply> be obtain by <work|form> outside the law. To play on the weakness of human nature, then on the weakness of nation--to get together and <control|ensure> a vast organization, and finally to overthrow the exist order, and rule! The think intoxicate me.... "... I saw that I must lead two live. A man like myself be bind to attract notice. I must have a successful career which would mask my true activity.... Also I must cultivate a personality. I model myself upon famous <K|THOUSAND>.C.'s. I reproduce their mannerism, their magnetism. If I have choose to be an actor, I should have be the <greatest|great> <actor|player> live! No disguise--no grease paint--no false beard! Personality! I put it on like a glove! When I shed it, I be myself, quiet, unobtrusive, a <man|human> like every other man. I call myself Mr. Brown. There be hundred of men call Brown--there be hundred of men look just like me.... "... I succeed in my false career. I be bind to succeed. I shall succeed in the other. A man like me cannot fail.... "... I have be <read|say> a life of Napoleon. He and I have much in common.... "... I make a practice of defend criminal. A <man|human> should look after his own people.... "... Once or <twice|doubly> I have felt afraid. The first <time|clip> be in Italy. There be a dinner give. Professor D----, the great alienist, be present. The talk <fell|come> on insanity. He say, 'A great many men be <mad|delirious>, and no one know it. They <do|make> not <know|recognize> it themselves.' I <do|make> not understand why he look at me when he say that. His glance be strange.... I do not like it.... "... The war have disturb me.... I think it would further my plan. The German be so efficient. Their spy system, too, be excellent. The street <be|follow> full of these boy in khaki. All empty-<head|question> young fool.... Yet I do not know.... They <win|acquire> the war.... It disturb me.... "... My plan be go well.... A girl butt in--I do not think she really know anything.... But we must <give|leave> up the Esthonia.... No risk now.... ".... All go well. The loss of memory be vex. "Still more romantic! The first _rencontre___ in the train from Paris, the second here. Journey end in lovers' meet, be not that the say?" "Don't be an as, Poirot." "Yesterday it be Mademoiselle Daubreuil, today it be Mademoiselle--Cinderella! Decidedly you have the <heart|affection> of a Turk, <hastings|Hastings>! You should establish a harem!" "It's all very well to rag me. Mademoiselle Daubreuil be a very beautiful girl, and I do admire her immensely--I don't mind admit it. The other's nothing--don't suppose I shall ever see her again. She be quite amuse to <talk|sing> to just for a railway journey, but she's not the <kind|sort> of <girl|fille> I should ever get keen on." "Why?" "Well--it sound snobbish <perhaps|possibly>--but she's not a lady, not in any sense of the word." Poirot nod thoughtfully. There be le <raillery|banter> in his voice a he ask: "You believe, then, in birth and breed?" "I may be old-fashion, but I certainly don't <believe|consider> in marry out of one's class. It never <answer|do>." "I agree with you, _mon ami___. Ninety-nine time out of a hundred, it be a you say. But there be always the hundredth time! Still, that <do|come> not arise, a you do not propose to see the lady again." His last word be almost a <question|wonder>, and I be aware of the sharpness with which he dart a glance at me. And before my eye, writ large in letter of fire, I saw the word "Hotel du Phare," and <I|SINGLE> hear again her voice say "Come and look me up" and my own <answer|resolve> with _empressement___: "I will." Well, what of it? I have mean to go at the time. But since then, I have have time to reflect. I do not like the girl. Think it over in cold <blood|rake>, I come definitely to the conclusion that I dislike her intensely. I have get haul over the coal for foolishly gratify her morbid curiosity, and I have not the least wish to see her again. I <answer|do> Poirot lightly enough. "She <ask|take> me to look her up, but of course I shan't." "Why 'of course'?" "Well--I don't want to." "I see." He study me attentively for some minute. "Yes. I see very well. And you be wise. Stick to what you have say." "That seem to be your invariable advice," I remark, rather pique. "Ah, my friend, have faith in <papa|dada> Poirot. Some day, if you permit, I <will|leave> arrange you a marriage of <great|large> suitability." "Thank you," I say <laugh|gag>, "but the prospect leave me cold." Poirot sigh and shake his <head|question>. "_Le Anglais!___" he murmur. "No method--absolutely none whatever. They leave all to chance!" He frown, and alter the position of the salt cellar. "Mademoiselle Cinderella be stay at the Hotel d'angleterre you <tell|say> me, do you not?" "No. Hotel du Phare." "True, I <forget|leave>." A moment's misgive shoot across my <mind|head>. Surely I have never mention any hotel to Poirot. I <look|expect> across at him, and felt reassure. He be cut his bread into neat little square, completely absorb in his task. He must have fancy I have tell him where the girl <be|follow> stay. We have coffee <outside|international> face the sea. Poirot smoke one of his tiny <cigarette|fag>, and then draw his watch from his pocket. "The <train|gear> to Paris leave at 2:25," he observe. "<I|SINGLE> should be start." "Paris?" I cry. "That be what I say, _mon ami___." "You be go to Paris? But why?" He reply very seriously. "To look for the murderer of M. Renauld." "You <think|remember> he be in Paris?" "I be quite certain that he be not. Nevertheless, it be there that I must look for him. You do not understand, but I will explain it all to you in good time. Believe me, this journey to Paris be necessary. I shall not be away long. In all probability I shall <return|take> tomorrow. I do not propose that you should <accompany|follow> me. Remain here and keep an <eye|heart> on Giraud. Also cultivate the <society|order> of <M|YARD>. Renauld _fils___. And thirdly, if you wish, endeavour to <cut|swing> him out with Mademoiselle Marthe. But <I|SINGLE> fear you will not <have|take> great success." I <do|come> not quite relish the last remark. "That remind me," I say. "I mean to ask you how you know about those two?" "_Mon ami___--I know human nature. <throw|shed> together a boy young Renauld and a beautiful girl like Mademoiselle Marthe, and the result be <almost|nearly> inevitable. Then, the quarrel! It be money or a woman and, remember Leonie's description of the lad's anger, I <decide|settle> on the latter. So I make my guess--and I <be|follow> right." "And that be why you warn me against set my heart <on|along> the lady? You already suspect that she love young Renauld?" Poirot smile. "At any rate--_I <saw|realize> that she have anxious eye.___ That be how always think of Mademoiselle Daubreuil _a the girl with the anxious eye. ...___" His voice be so grave that it impress me uncomfortably. "What do you mean by that, Poirot?" "I fancy, my friend, that we shall see before very long. But I must start." "You've ocean of time." "Perhaps--perhaps. But I like plenty of leisure at the station. I do not wish to rush, to hurry, to excite myself." "At all event," I say, rise, "I will come and see you off." "You will do nothing of the sort. I forbid it." He be so peremptory that I star at him in surprise. He nod emphatically. "I mean it, _mon ami___. Au revoir! You permit that I embrace you? Ah, no, I forget that it be not the English custom. Une poignee de main, alors." I felt <rather|instead> at a loose end after Poirot have leave me. I stroll down the beach, and <watch|see> the bather, without feel energetic enough to join them. I rather fancy that Cinderella might <be|follow> disport herself amongst them in some wonderful costume, but I <saw|find> no sign of her. I <stroll|saunter> aimlessly along the sand towards the further end of the town. It occur to me that, after all, it would only be decent feel on my part to inquire after the girl. And it would save <trouble|distract> in the end. The matter would then be finish with. There would be no need for me to trouble about her any further. But, if I do not go at all, she might quite possibly come and look me up at the Villa. And that would be annoy in every way. Decidedly it would be better to pay a short call, in the course of which I could make it <quite|rather> clear that I could do nothing further for her in my capacity of showman. Accordingly I leave the beach, and walk inland. I soon find the Hotel du Phare, a very unpretentious <build|establish>. It <be|follow> annoy in the extreme not to know the lady's name and, to save my dignity, I decide to stroll inside and <look|expect> around. Probably I should find her in the lounge. Merlinville be a small <place|station>, you leave your hotel to go to the beach, and you leave the beach to <return|take> to the hotel. There be no other attraction. There be a Casino be build, but it be not <yet|still> complete. I have walk the length of the beach without <see|find> her, therefore she must be in the hotel. I go in. <several|various> people be sit in the tiny lounge, but my quarry be not amongst them. I look into some other room, but there be no sign of her. I wait for some <time|clip>, till my impatience get the <better|upright> of me. I take the concierge aside, and slip five franc into his hand. "I wish to see a lady who be stay here. A young English lady, <small|little> and dark. I be not sure of her name." The man shake his head, and seem to be suppress a grin. "There be no such lady a you describe stay here." "She be American <possibly|maybe>," I suggest. These <fellow|familiar> be so stupid. But the man <continue|keep> to shake his head. "No, monsieur. There be only six or seven English and American lady altogether, and they be all much older than the lady you be seek. It be not here that you will find her, monsieur." He be so positive that I felt doubt. "But the lady tell me she be stay here." "Monsieur must have make a mistake--or it be more likely the lady do, since there have <be|follow> another <gentleman|man> here inquire for her." "What be that you say?" <I|SINGLE> cry, surprise. "But yes, monsieur. A gentleman who describe her just a you <have|make> do." "What <be|follow> he like?" "He be a <small|little> gentleman, well dress, very neat, very spotless, the moustache <very|really> stiff, the head of a peculiar <shape|frame>, and the eye green." Poirot! So that be why he refuse to let me accompany him to the station. The <impertinence|gall> of it! I would thank him not to meddle in my concern. Do he fancy I <need|take> a nurse to <look|see> after me? Thank the man, I <depart|leave>, somewhat at a loss, and still much incense with my meddlesome friend. I regret that he <be|follow>, for the moment, out of reach. I should have enjoy tell him what I think of his unwarranted interference. Have I not distinctly tell him that I have no intention of see the girl? Decidedly, one's friend can be too zealous! But where be the lady? I set aside my wrath, and try to puzzle it out. Evidently, through inadvertence, she have name the wrong hotel. Then another think strike me. Be it inadvertence? Or <have|let> she deliberately withhold her name and give me the wrong address? The more I think about it, the more I <felt|find> convince that this last surmise of mine be <right|rectify>. For some reason or other she do not wish to let the acquaintance ripen into friendship. And though half an hour <earlier|early> this have be precisely my own <view|vista>, I do not enjoy have the table <turn|act> upon me. The whole affair be profoundly unsatisfactory, and I <go|fling> up to the Villa Genevieve in a condition of distinct ill humour. I do not go to the house, but go up the <path|route> to the little bench by the shed, and sit there moodily enough. I be distract from my thought by the sound of voice close at hand. In a second or two I <realize|make> that they come, not from the garden I be in, but from the adjoin garden of the Villa <marguerite|marguerite_daisy>, and that they be approach rapidly. A girl's voice <be|follow> speak, a voice that <I|SINGLE> recognize a that of the beautiful Marthe. "_Cheri___," she be say, "<be|follow> it really true? Be all our trouble over." "You know it, Marthe," Jack Renauld reply. "Nothing can part u now, beloved. The last obstacle to our union be remove. Nothing can <take|remove> you from me." "Nothing?" the girl murmur. "Oh, Jack, Jack--I be afraid." I have <move|run> to depart, realize that <I|SINGLE> be quite unintentionally eavesdrop. A I <rise|rear> to my foot, I catch <sight|deal> of them through a gap in the hedge. They stand together face me, the man's arm round the girl, his eye look into hers. They be a splendid look couple, the dark, well-knit boy, and the <fair|average> young goddess. They seem make for each other a they stand there, happy in <spite|offend> of the <terrible|severe> tragedy that overshadow their young live. But the girl's face be trouble, and Jack Renauld seem to recognize it, a he hold her closer to him and ask: "But what be you afraid of, darling? What be there to fear--now?" And then I saw the look in her eye, the look Poirot have speak of, a she murmur, so that I almost <guess|supposition> at the word. "I be afraid--for _you___. ..." I do not hear young Renauld's answer, for my attention be distract by an unusual appearance a little further down the hedge. There appear to <be|follow> a brown bush there, which seem <odd|curious>, to say the least of it, so early in the summer. I step along to investigate, but, at my advance, the brown <bush|scrub> <withdraw|take> itself precipitately, and face me with a finger to it lip. It be Giraud. Enjoin caution, he lead the way round the shed until we be out of ear-<shoot|charge>. "What be you do there?" I ask. "Exactly what you <be|follow> do--listen." "But I be not there on purpose!" "Ah!" say Giraud. "I be." A always, I admire the man whilst dislike him. He <look|appear> me up and down with a sort of contemptuous disfavour. "You didn't help matter by butt in. I might <have|make> hear something useful in a minute. What have you do with your old fossil?" "M. Poirot <have|get> go to Paris," I reply coldly. "And I can <tell|say> you, M. Giraud, that he be anything but an old fossil. He <have|give> solve many case that <have|give> completely baffle the English police." "Bah! The English police!" Giraud snap his finger disdainfully. "They must be on a level with our examine magistrate. So he have go to Paris, <have|give> he? Well, a <good|respectable> thing. The longer he stay there, the <better|serious>. But what do he think he will find there?" <I|SINGLE> <think|remember> I <read|take> in the question a tinge of uneasiness. I <draw|drag> myself up. "That I be not at liberty to say," I say quietly. Giraud <subject|capable> me to a pierce stare. "He have probably enough sense not to <tell|say> _you___," he remark rudely. "Good afternoon. I'm busy." And with that, he turn <on|along> his heel, and <leave|allow> me without ceremony. Matter seem at a standstill at the Villa Genevieve. Giraud evidently do not desire my company and, from what I have see, it seem fairly certain that Jack Renauld do not either. I go back to the town, have an enjoyable bath and return to the hotel. I turn in early, wonder whether the follow day would bring forth anything of interest. I be wholly unprepared for what it do bring forth. I be eat my petit dejeuner in the din-room, when the waiter, who have be talk to some one <outside|international>, come back in obvious excitement. He hesitate for a <minute|instant>, fidget with his napkin, and then burst out. "Monsieur will pardon me, but he be <connect|unite>, be he not, with the affair at the Villa Genevieve?' "Yes," I say eagerly. "Why?" "Monsieur <have|take> not hear the news, though?" "What news?" "That there have be another murder there last <night|dark>!" "_What?___" <leave|allow> my breakfast, I catch up my hat and run a fast a I could. Another murder--and Poirot away! What fatality. But who <have|take> be murder? I <dash|daunt> in at the gate. A group of the servant be in the <drive|campaign>, talk and <gesticulate|motion>. I catch hold of Francoise. "What have happen?" "Oh, monsieur! monsieur! Another death! It be terrible. There be a <curse|swear> upon the house. But yes, I say it, a <curse|excommunicate>! They should send for M. le cure to bring some holy water. Never <will|leave> I sleep another night under that roof. It might be my turn, who know?" She cross herself. "Yes," I <cry|exclaim>, "but who have be kill?" "Do I know--me? A man--a stranger. They find him up there--in the shed--not a hundred <yard|thousand> from where they find poor Monsieur. And that be not all. He be stab--stab to the heart _with the same dagger!___" Wait for no more, I turn and <run|go> up the path to the shed. The two men on guard there stand aside to let me pas and, fill with excitement, I enter. The light be dim, the place be a mere <rough|boisterous> wooden erection to keep old pot and tool in. I have enter impetuously, but on the threshold I check myself, fascinate by the spectacle before me. Giraud be on his hand and knee, a pocket torch in his hand with which he be examine every inch of the grind. He look up with a frown at my entrance, then his <face|front> relax a <little|trivial> in a sort of good-humour contempt. "Ah, _c'est l'anglais!___ <enter|introduce> then. Let u see what you can make of this affair." <rather|quite> sting by his tone, I stoop my head, and pas in. "There he be," say Giraud, flash his torch to the far corner. I step across. The dead man lay straight upon his back. He be of medium height, swarthy of complexion, and possibly <about|near> fifty year of age. He be neatly dress in a dark <blue|profane> suit, <well|considerably> cut and probably make by an expensive tailor, but not new. His face be terribly convulse, and on his leave side, just over the heart, the hilt of a dagger stand up, black and shin. I recognize it. It be the same dagger I have see repose in the glass jar the precede morning! "I'm expect the doctor <any|whatever> minute," explain Giraud. "Although we hardly <need|take> him. There's no doubt what the man die of. He be stab to the <heart|centre>, and death must have be pretty well instantaneous." "When be it do? Last night?" Giraud shake his head. "<hardly|just>. I don't lay down the law on medical evidence, but the man's be dead <well|intimately> over twelve hour. When do you say you last saw that dagger?" "About ten o'clock yesterday <morning|daybreak>." "Then I should be incline to fix the crime a be do not long after that." "But people be pas and repassing this shed continually." Giraud laugh disagreeably. "You progress to a marvel! Who tell you he be kill in this shed?" "Well I felt fluster. "I--I assume it." "Oh, what a fine detective! Look at him, _mon petit___--do a man stab to the heart fall like that--neatly with his foot together, and his arm to his <side|incline>? No. Again <do|make> a man lie down on his back and permit himself to be stab without raise a hand to defend himself? It be absurd, be it not? But see here--and here He flash the torch along the <grind|fag>. I saw curious irregular mark in the soft <dirt|grime>. "He be drag here after he be dead. Half drag, half <carry|sway> by two people. Their track do not show <on|along> the hard grind outside, and here they have be careful to obliterate them--but one of the two be a woman, my young friend." "A woman?" "Yes." "But if the track be obliterate, how do you know?" "Because, blur a they be, the print of the woman's shoe be unmistakable. Also, by _this___ And, lean forward, he draw something from the handle of the dagger and hold it up for me to <see|ensure>. It be a woman's long black hair--similar to the one Poirot have take from the arm-chair in the library. With a <slightly|somewhat> ironic smile he wind it round the dagger again. "We will leave thing a they be a <much|practically> a possible," he explain. "It please the examine magistrate. _Eh bien___, do you notice anything else?" I be force to shake my head. "Look at his hand." I do. The <nail|smash> be break and discolour, and the skin be hard. It hardly enlighten me a much a I should <have|give> like it to <have|give> <do|come>. I look up at Giraud. "They be not the <hand|deal> of a gentleman," he say, answer my look. "On the contrary his clothe <be|follow> those of a well-to-do man. That be curious, be it not?" "Very curious," I agree. "And none of his clothe be mark. What do we learn from that? This man be try to pas himself off a other than he be. He be masquerade. Why? Do he fear something? <be|follow> he try to escape by disguise himself? A yet we do not know, but one thing we <do|make> know--he be a anxious to conceal his <identity|individuality> a we be to discover it." He look down at the <body|consistence> again. "A before there be no finger-print on the handle of the dagger. The murderer again wear glove." "You think, then, that the murderer be the same in both case?" I <ask|take> eagerly. Giraud become inscrutable. "Never mind what I think. We shall see. Marchaud!" The _sergent de ville___ appear at the doorway. "Monsieur?" "Why be Madame Renauld not here? I send for her a quarter of an hour ago?" "She be come up the path now, monsieur, and her son with her." "Good. I only want one at a time, though." Marchaud salute and disappear again. A moment later he reappear with Mr. Renauld. "Here be Madame." Giraud come forward with a curt bow. "This way, madame." He lead her across, and then, stand suddenly <aside|away>. "Here be the <man|world>. Do you know him?" And a he speak, his eye, gimlet-like, bore into her <face|expression>, seek to read her mind, note every indication of her <manner|fashion>. But Mr. Renauld remain perfectly calm--<too|excessively> Nadina shake her <head|manoeuvre>. "No, no, that be not the way of it. Listen, my friend, to-morrow I go to London." "But your contract here?" "I shall be away only one night. And I go incognito, like Royalty. No one will ever know that I have leave France. And why do you think that I go?" "Hardly for pleasure at this time of year. January, a detestable foggy month! It must be for profit, eh?" "Exactly." She rise and stand in <front|presence> of him, every graceful line of her arrogant with pride. "You say just now that none of u have anything on the <chief|principal>. You be wrong. I have. I, a woman, have have the wit and, yes, the courage--for it need courage--to double-cross him. You remember the De Beer diamond?" "Yes, I remember. At Kimberley, just before the war break out? I have nothing to <do|come> with it, and I never <hear|see> the detail, the <case|subject> be hush up for some reason, be it not? A fine haul too." "A hundred thousand pound worth of stone. Two of u work it--under the 'Colonel's' order, of course. And it be then that I saw my chance. You see, the plan be to substitute some of the De Beer diamond for some sample diamond bring from South America by two young prospector who happen to be in Kimberley at the time. Suspicion be then bind to fall on them." "Very clever," interpolate the Count approvingly. "The 'Colonel' be <always|invariably> clever. Well, I do my <part|character>--but I <also|likewise> do one thing which the 'Colonel' have not foresee. I keep back some of the South American stone--one or two be unique and could <easily|well> be prove never to have pas through De Beer's hand. With these diamond in my possession, I have the whip-hand of my esteem chief. Once the two young men be clear, his part in the matter be bind to be suspect. I have say nothing all these <year|twelvemonth>, I have be content to know that I have this weapon in <reserve|book>, but now matter be different. I want my price--and it will be a big, I might almost say a stagger price." "Extraordinary," say the Count. "And doubtless you carry these diamond <about|near> with you everywhere?" His eye roam gently round the disorder room. Nadina laugh softly. "You need suppose nothing of the sort. I be not a fool. The diamond be in a <safe|good> place where no one will dream of look for them." "I never think you a fool, my dear lady, but may I venture to suggest that you be somewhat foolhardy? The 'Colonel' be not the type of man to take kindly to be blackmail, you know." "I be not afraid of him," she laugh. "There be only one man I have ever fear--and he be dead." The man look at her curiously. "Let u hope that he will not come to life again, then," he remark lightly. "What do you mean?" cry the dancer sharply. The Count look slightly surprise. "I only mean that a <resurrection|Christ's_Resurrection> would be awkward for you," he explain. "A foolish joke." She give a sigh of relief. "Oh, no, he be dead all right. Kill in the war. He be a man who once--love me." "In South Africa?" ask the Count negligently. "Yes, since you ask it, in South Africa." "That be your native country, be it not?" She nod. Her visitor rise and reach for his hat. "Well," he remark, "you <know|recognize> your own business best, but, if I be you, I should fear the 'Colonel' far more than any <disillusion|disillusionment> lover. He be a man whom it be particularly easy to--underestimate." She laugh <scornfully|contumeliously>. "A if I do not know him after all these year!" "I wonder if you do?" he say softly. "I very much wonder if you <do|make>." "Oh, I be not a <fool|befool>! And I be not alone in this. The South African mail-boat dock at Southampton to-morrow, and on <board|panel> her be a man who have come specially from Africa at my request and who have <carry|take> out certain order of mine. The 'Colonel' will have not one of u to <deal|consider> with, but two." "Be that wise?" "It be necessary." "You be sure of this man?" A rather peculiar smile play over the dancer's <face|nerve>. "I be quite sure of him. He be inefficient, but perfectly trustworthy." She pause, and then add in an indifferent tone of voice: "A a <matter|thing> of fact, he <happen|find> to be my husband." Everybody have <be|follow> at me, right and leave, to write this story from the <great|big> (<represent|play> by Lord Nasby) to the small (represent by our late maid of all <work|lick>, Emily, whom I <saw|find> when I be last in England. "Lor', miss, what a beyewtiful <book|reserve> you might <make|take> out of it all--just like the <picture|project>!"). I'll admit that I've certain qualification for the task. I be mix up in the affair from the very begin, I be in the <thick|midst> of it all through, and I be triumphantly "in at the <death|destruction>." Very fortunately, too, the gap that I cannot supply from my own knowledge be amply cover by Sir Eustace Pedler's diary, of which he have kindly beg me to make <use|role>. So here go. Anne Beddingfeld start to narrate her adventure. I'd always long for adventure. You see, my life <have|get> such a dreadful sameness. My father, Professor Beddingfeld, be one of England's greatest live authority on Primitive <man|world>. He really be a genius--every one admit that. His mind dwell in Palaeolithic time, and the inconvenience of life for him be that his body inhabit the modern world. Papa do not care for modern <man|human>--even Neolithic Man he despise a a mere herder of cattle, and he do not rise to enthusiasm until he reach the Mousterian period. Unfortunately one cannot entirely dispense with modern men. One be force to have some <kind|tolerant> of truck with butcher and baker and milkman and greengrocer. Therefore, Papa <be|follow> immerse in the past, Mamma have die when I be a <baby|spoil>, it fell to me to undertake the practical <side|slope> of live. Frankly, I hate Palaeolithic Man, be he Aurignacian, Mousterian, Chellian, or anything else, and though I type and <revise|rescript> most of Papa's _<neanderthal|neandertal> Man and his Ancestor,_ Neanderthal men themselves fill me with loathe, and I <always|invariably> reflect what a <fortunate|golden> circumstance it be that they become extinct in remote age. I do not know whether Papa guess my feel on the subject, probably not, and in any case he would not have be interest. The opinion of other people never interest him in the slightest degree. I think it be really a sign of his greatness. In the same way, he live quite detach from the necessity of daily life. He eat what <be|follow> put before him in an exemplary fashion, but seem mildly pain when the question of pay for it arise. We never seem to have any money. His celebrity be not of the <kind|sort> that bring in a <cash|immediate_payment> <return|recall>. Although he <be|follow> a fellow of almost every important <society|companionship>, and have row of letter after his name, the general public scarcely know of his existence, and his long learn book, though add signally to the <sum|total>-total of human knowledge, have no attraction for the <mass|sight>. <only|entirely> on one <occasion|function> do he leap into the public gaze. He have read a paper before some society on the subject of the <young|new> of the <chimpanzee|chimp>. The young of the human race show some anthropoid feature, whereas the young of the chimpanzee <approach|advance> more nearly to the human than the adult <chimpanzee|chimp> do. That seem to show that whereas our ancestor be more Simian than we be, the chimpanzee's be of a higher type than the present specie--in other word, the chimpanzee be a degenerate. That enterprising newspaper, the _Daily Budget,_ be hard up for something spicy, immediately bring itself out with large headline. "We be not descend from monkey, but be monkey descend from _u?_ Eminent Professor say chimpanzee be decadent human." Shortly afterwards a reporter call to see Papa, and endeavour to induce him to write a series of popular article on the theory. I have seldom see Papa so angry. He turn the reporter out of the house with scant ceremony, much to my secret sorrow, a we be <particularly|specially> short of money at the moment. In fact, for a moment I meditate run after the young man and inform him that my father have change his mind and would send the article in question. I could easily have <write|pen> them myself, and the <probability|chance> be that Papa would never have learn of the <transaction|dealings>, not be a reader of the _Daily Budget._ However, I reject this course a be <too|likewise> risky, so <I|SINGLE> merely put on my best hat and go sadly down the village to interview our justly irate grocer. The reporter from the _<daily|casual> Budget_ be the only young man who <ever|always> come to our house. There be time when I envy Emily, our little servant, who "walk out" whenever <occasion|affair> offer with a large sailor to whom she be affiance. In between time, to "keep her hand in" a she express it, she walk out with the greengrocer's <young|new> man, and the chemist's assistant. I reflect sadly that I have no <one|nonpareil> to "keep my hand in" with. All Papa's friend be age Professor--usually with long beard. It be true that Professor Peterson once clasp me affectionately and say I have a "neat little waist" and then try to kiss me. The phrase <alone|lonely> date him hopelessly. No self-<respect|obedience> female have have a "neat little waist" since I be in my cradle. I yearn for adventure, for love, for romance, and I seem condemn to an <existence|world> of <drab|dreary> utility. The village posse a lend library, full of tattered work of fiction, and I enjoy <peril|menace> and love-make at second hand, and go to sleep dream of stern, silent Rhodesians, and of strong men who always "fell their opponent with a single blow." There be no one in the village who even look a though he could "fell" an opponent, with a single blow or with several. There be the Kinema too, with a weekly episode of "The Peril of Pamela." Pamela be a magnificent young woman. Nothing daunt her. She fell out of aeroplane, adventure in submarine, climb skyscraper and creep about in the Underworld without turn a hair. She be not really clever, the Master Criminal of the Underworld catch her each time, but a he seem loath to <knock|criticize> her on the <head|steer> in a <simple|elementary> way, and <always|constantly> doom her to death in a <sewer|gutter>-gas chamber or by some new and marvellous mean, the hero be always able to rescue her at the begin of the follow week's episode. I <use|apply> to come out with my head in a <delirious|frantic> whirl--and then I would get <home|base> and find a notice from the Gas Company threaten to cut u off if the outstanding <account|score> be not pay! And yet, though I do not suspect it, every <moment|bit> be bring adventure nearer to me. It be possible that there be many <people|mass> in the world who have never hear of the find of an antique skull at the Break Hill Mine in Northern Rhodesia. I come down one <morning|aurora> to find Papa excite to the point of apoplexy. He pour out the whole <story|account> to me. "You understand, Anne? There be undoubtedly certain resemblance to the Java skull, but superficial--superficial only. No, here we <have|get> what I have always maintain--the ancestral form of the Neanderthal <race|hasten>. You grant that the Gibraltar skull be the most <primitive|naive> of the Neanderthal skull find? Why? The cradle of the race be in Africa. They pas to Europe-- "Not marmalade on kipper, papa," I say hastily, arrest my parent's absent-mind <hand|deal>. "Yes, you be say?" "They pas to Europe on-- Here he break down with a bad fit of choke, the <result|answer> of an immoderate mouthful of kipper-bone. "But we must start at <once|formerly>," he declare, a he rise to his foot at the conclusion of the meal. "There be no time to be lose. We must be on the spot--there be doubtless incalculable <find|ascertain> to be find in the neighbourhood. I shall be interest to note whether the implement be typical of the Mousterian period--there will be the remain of the primitive ox, I should say, but not those of the woolly rhinoceros. Yes, a little army will be start soon. We must get ahead of them. You will <write|pen> to Cook's to-day, Anne?" "What about money, papa?" I hint delicately. He turn a reproachful eye upon me. "Your point of view always depress me, my child. We must not be sordid. No, no, in the cause of science one must not be sordid." "I feel Cook's might be sordid, papa." <papa|pop> look pain. "My dear Anne, you will pay them in ready money." "I haven't <get|go> any ready money." <papa|pop> look thoroughly exasperate. "My child, I really cannot be bother with these <vulgar|coarse> money detail. The bank--I have something from the Manager yesterday, say I have twenty-seven pound." "That's your overdraft, I fancy." "Ah, I have it! Write to my publisher." I acquiesce doubtfully, Papa's book bring in more glory than money. I like the idea of go to Rhodesia immensely. "Stern silent men," I murmur to myself in an ecstasy. Then something in my parent's appearance strike me a unusual. "You have odd boot on, papa," I say. "Take off the brown one and put on the other black one. And don't forget your muffler. It's a very cold day." In a few minute Papa stalk off, correctly boot and <well|easily> mufflered. He <return|take> late that even, and, to my dismay, I saw his muffler and overcoat be miss. "<dear|near> me, Anne, you be quite <right|good>. I <take|consider> them off to go into the cavern. One get so dirty there." I nod feelingly, remember an occasion when <papa|pa> have <return|take> literally plaster from head to <foot|infantry> with rich Pleiocene clay. Our <principal|main> <reason|conclude> for settle in Little Hampsly have be the neighbourhood of Hampsly Cavern, a bury cave rich in deposit of the Aurignacian culture. We have a tiny Museum in the village, and the curator and Papa spend most of their day mess about underground and bring to light portion of woolly rhinoceros and cave bear. Papa cough badly all the even, and the follow morning I saw he have a temperature and <send|beam> for the doctor. Poor Papa, he never <have|let> a chance. It be double pneumonia. He die four day later. Every one be very <kind|tolerant> to me. Daze a I be, I appreciate that. I felt no overwhelm <grief|sorrow>. Papa have never love me, I know that well enough. If he have, I might <have|give> love him in return. No, there have not be love between u, but we have belong together, and I have look after him, and have secretly admire his <learn|watch> and his uncompromising devotion to science. And it hurt me that Papa should have die just when the interest of life be at it height for him. I should have felt happier if I could have <bury|sink> him in a cave, with paint of reindeer and flint implement, but the force of public <opinion|belief> constrain a neat tomb (with marble slab) in our hideous local churchyard. The vicar's consolation, though well mean, do not console me in the least. It take some time to dawn upon me that the thing I have always long for--freedom--be at last mine. I be an orphan, and practically penniless, but free. At the same time I <realize|make> the extraordinary kindness of all these good people. The vicar do his best to persuade me that his wife be in urgent <need|involve> of a companion help. Our tiny local library suddenly make up it mind to have an assistant librarian. Finally, the doctor <call|scream> upon me, and after make various <ridiculous|pathetic> excuse for fail to send in a proper bill, he hum and haw a good <deal|distribute> and suddenly suggest that I should marry him. I be very much astonish. The <doctor|medico> be nearer forty than thirty, and a round, <tubby|podgy> little man. He be not at all like the <hero|fighter> of "The Peril of Pamela," and even le like a stern and silent Rhodesian. I reflect a minute and then ask him why he want to marry me. That seem to fluster him a good deal, and he murmur that a wife be a great help to a General Practitioner. The position <seem|appear> even more unromantic than before, and yet something in me urge towards it acceptance. <safety|guard>, that be what <I|SINGLE> be be offer. Safety--and a Comfortable Home. Think it over now, I believe I do the little man an injustice. He be honestly in love with me, but a <mistake|slip> delicacy prevent him from press his suit <on|along> those line. Anyway, my love of romance rebel. "It's extremely <kind|tolerant> of you," I say. "But it's impossible. I could never marry a man unless I love him madly." "You don't think----?" "No, I don't," I say firmly. He sigh. "But, my dear child, what <do|come> you propose to do?" "Have adventure and see the world," I reply, without the least hesitation. "Miss Anne, you be very much of a child still. You don't understand-- "The practical difficulty? Yes, I do, doctor. I'm not a sentimental schoolgirl--I'm a hard-head <mercenary|materialistic> shrew! You'd know it if you marry me!" "I wish you would reconsider-- "I can't." He sigh again. "I have another <proposal|proposition> to make. An aunt of mine who live in Wale be in want of a young lady to help her. How would that suit you?" "No, doctor, I'm go to London. If thing happen anywhere, they happen in London. I shall keep my eye open and you'll see, something will turn up! You'll hear of me next in China or Timbuctoo." My next visitor be Mr. Flemming, Papa's London solicitor. He come down <specially|particularly> from town to see me. An ardent anthropologist himself, he be a great admirer of Papa's work. He be a tall, <spare|free> man with a thin face and grey hair. He rise to meet me a I enter the room and, take both my hand in his, pat them affectionately. "My poor child," he say. "My poor, poor child." Without conscious hypocrisy, I find myself assume the demeanour of a bereave orphan. He hypnotize me into it. He be <benignant|gracious>, kind and fatherly--and without the least <doubt|question> he <regard|see> me a a perfect fool of a girl leave adrift to face an unkind world. From the first I felt that it be quite useless to try to convince him of the contrary. A thing <turn|routine> out, <perhaps|possibly> it be just a <well|swell> I didn't. "My dear child, do you think you can listen to me whilst I try to make a few <thing|affair> clear to you?" "Oh, yes." "Your father, a you know, be a very great man. Posterity will appreciate him. But he be not a good <man|valet> of business." I know that quite a well, if not better than Mr. Flemming, but I restrain myself from say so. He <continue|keep>: "I do not suppose you understand much of these matter. I will try to explain a clearly a I can." He explain at unnecessary length. The upshot seem to be that I be leave to face life with the <sum|aggregate> of PS87, 17. 4d. It seem a strangely unsatisfying amount. <I|SINGLE> wait in some trepidation for what be come next. I fear that Mr. Flemming would be sure to have an aunt in Scotland who be in want of a bright young companion. <apparently|evidently>, however, he hadn't. "The question be," he go on, "the future. I understand you have no live relative?" "I'm alone in the world," I say, and be strike anew by my liken to a film heroine. "You have friend?" "Every one <have|make> be very kind to me," I say gratefully. "Who would not be kind to one so young and charm?" say Mr. Flemming gallantly. "Well, well, my dear, we must see what can be do." He hesitate a minute, and then say: "Suppose--how would it be if you come to u for a time?" I jump at the chance. London! The place for <thing|matter> to happen. "It's awfully kind of you," I say. "Might I really? <just|hardly> while I'm look round. I must start out to earn my live, you know?" "Yes, yes, my dear child. I quite <understand|see>. We will look round for something--suitable." I <felt|find> instinctively that Mr. Flemming's idea of "something suitable" and mine be likely to be widely divergent, but it be certainly not the moment I ring the bell, and a smile Kafir boy answer it. "Mr. Raffini?" I inquire. He usher me in, precede me down the passage and fling open a door. <just|precisely> a I be about to pas in, I hesitate. I felt a sudden misgive. I step over the threshold and the door swing sharply to <behind|slow> me. A man rise from his seat behind a <table|board> and come forward with outstretched hand. "So <glad|happy> we have persuade you to visit u, Miss Beddingfeld," he say. He be a <tall|improbable> man, <obviously|evidently> a Dutchman, with a flame orange beard. He <do|come> not look in the least like the curator of a museum. In fact, <I|SINGLE> realize in a flash that I have make a <fool|befool> of myself. I be in the hand of the enemy. It remind me forcibly of <episode|sequence> III in "The Peril of Pamela." How often <have|get> I not sit in the sixpenny seat, eat a twopenny bar of milk chocolate, and yearn for similar thing to <happen|find> to me. Well, they have happen with a vengeance. And somehow it be not nearly so amuse a I have imagine. It's all very <well|intimately> on the screen--you have the comfortable knowledge that there's bind to be an Episode IV. But in real life there be absolutely no guarantee that Anna the Adventure might not terminate abruptly at the end of any Episode. Yes, I be in a tight place. All the thing that Rayburn have say that morning come back to me with unpleasant distinctness. Tell the truth, he <have|make> say. Well, I could always do that, but be it go to help me? To begin with, would my story be believe? Would they <consider|see> it likely or possible that I have start off on this <mad|delirious> <escapade|adventure> <simply|just> on the strength of a scrap of paper smell of moth ball? It sound to me a wildly incredible tale. In that moment of cold sanity I curse myself for a melodramatic idiot, and yearn for the peaceful <boredom|tedium> of Little Hampsly. All this pas through my mind in le time than it <take|make> to tell. My first instinctive movement be to step backwards and feel for the handle of the door. My captor merely grin. "Here you be and here you stay," he remark facetiously. <I|SINGLE> do my best to put a bold face upon the matter. "I be invite to <come|follow> here by the curator of the Cape Town Museum. If I have make a mistake-- "A mistake? Oh, yes, a big mistake!" He laugh coarsely. "What right have you to detain me? I shall inform the police-- "Yap, yap, yap--like a little toy <dog|blackguard>." He laugh. I sit down on a chair. "I can only conclude that you be a dangerous lunatic," I say coldly. "Indeed?" "I should like to point out to you that my friend be perfectly well aware where I have go, and that if I have not return by this even, they will come in search of me. You understand?" "<so|thus> your friend know where you <be|follow>, <do|come> they? Which of them?" Thus challenge, I do a lightning calculation of chance. Should I mention Sir Eustace? He be a well-know man, and his name might carry weight. But if they be in touch with Pagett, they might know I be lie. Better not risk Sir Eustace. "Mr. Blair, for one," I say lightly. "A <friend|admirer> of mine with whom I be stay." "I think not," say my captor, slyly shake his orange head. "You have not see her since eleven this morning. And you receive our note, bid you come here, at lunch-time." His word show me how closely my movement have <be|follow> follow, but <I|SINGLE> be not go to give in without a fight. "You be very clever," I say. "Perhaps you have hear of that useful invention, the telephone? Mr. Blair call me up on it when I be rest in my room after lunch. I tell her then where I be go this afternoon." To my great satisfaction, I saw a shade of uneasiness pas over his face. Clearly he <have|give> overlook the possibility that Suzanne might <have|take> telephone to me. I wish she <really|very> have do so! "Enough of this," he say harshly, <rise|develop>. "What be you <go|fling> to do with me?" I <ask|expect>, still endeavour to appear compose. "Put you where you can do no harm in case your friend come after you." For a moment my <blood|line> run cold, but his next word reassure me. "To-morrow you'll have some question to <answer|do>, and after you've answer them we shall know what to do with you. And I can tell you, young lady, we've more way than one of make obstinate little fool talk." It be not cheer, but it be at least a respite. I have until to-morrow. This <man|human> be clearly an underling obey the <order|govern> of a superior. Could that superior by any chance be Pagett? He call and two Kafir appear. <I|SINGLE> be <take|acquire> upstairs. Despite my <struggle|conflict>, I be gag and then bind hand and foot. The room into which they have take me be a kind of attic right under the roof. It be dusty and show <little|short> sign of have be occupy. The Dutchman <make|take> a mock bow and withdraw, close the door behind him. I be quite helpless. Turn and twist a I would, I could not loosen my hand in the slightest degree, and the gag prevent me from cry out. If, by any possible chance, any one do come to the house, I could <do|come> nothing to attract their attention. Down below I hear the sound of a door shut. Evidently the Dutchman be go out. It be madden not to be able to <do|make> anything. I strain again at my bond, but the knot <hold|take>. <I|SINGLE> desist at last, and either <faint|vague> or fell asleep. When I awake I be in <pain|annoyance> all over. It be quite dark now, and I judge that the <night|dark> must be <well|easily> advance, for the moon <be|follow> high in the heaven and shin down through the dusty skylight. The gag <be|follow> half choke me and the <stiffness|inclemency> and pain be unendurable. It <be|follow> then that my eye fell on a bite of <break|separate> glass lie in the corner. A moonbeam slant right down on it, and it glisten have <catch|get> my attention. A I <look|front> at it, an idea come into my head. My <arm|sleeve> and <leg|peg> be helpless, but surely I could still _roll._ Slowly and awkwardly, I set myself in motion. It be not easy. Besides be extremely painful, since I could not guard my face with my arm, it be also exceedingly difficult to keep any particular direction. I tend to roll in every direction except the one I want to go. In the end, however, I come right up against my objective. It almost touch my bind <hand|deal>. Even then it be not <easy|promiscuous>. It take an infinity of time before I could wriggle the <glass|ice> into such a position, wedge against the wall, that it would rub up and down on my <bond|bind>. It be a long heart-rend process, and I almost despair, but in the end I succeed in saw through the cord that bind my wrist. The rest <be|follow> a matter of time. Once I have restore the circulation to my hand by rub the wrist vigorously, I be able to undo the gag. One or two full breath do a lot for me. Very soon I <have|make> undo the last knot, though <even|yet> then it be some time before I could stand on my foot, but at last I stand erect, swing my arm to and fro to restore the circulation, and wish above all thing that I could <get|find> hold of something to eat. <I|SINGLE> wait about a quarter of an hour, to be quite sure of my recover strength. Then I tiptoe noiselessly to the door. A I have hop, it be not lock, <only|merely> latch. I unlatched it and peep cautiously out. Everything be still. The moonlight <come|occur> in through a window and show me the dusty uncarpeted staircase. Cautiously I creep down it. <still|yet> no sound--but a I stand <on|along> the <land|estate> below, a faint murmur of voice <reach|give> me. I stop dead and stand there for some time. A clock <on|along> the wall register the fact that it be after midnight. I be fully aware of the risk I might run if I descend lower, but my curiosity be too much for me. With infinite precaution I <prepare|develop> to explore. I creep softly down the last flight of <stair|step> and <stand|tolerate> in the <square|lame> <hall|residence>. <I|SINGLE> look round me--and then catch my breath with a gasp. A Kafir boy be sit by the hall door. He have not <see|consider> me, indeed I soon realize by his <breathe|rest> that he be fast asleep. Should I retreat, or should I go on? The voice come from the room I have be show into on arrival. One of them be that of my Dutch friend, the other I could not for the moment recognize, though it seem vaguely familiar. In the end I decide that it be clearly my <duty|tariff> to hear all I could. I must risk the Kafir boy wake up. I cross the hall noiselessly and kneel by the study door. For a moment or two I could hear no <better|full>. The voice be louder, but I could not distinguish what they say. I apply my eye to the keyhole instead of my ear. A I have guess, one of the speaker be the big Dutchman. The other man be sit outside my circumscribe range of <vision|sight>. Suddenly he <rise|develop> to get himself a drink. His back, black clothe and decorous, come into view. Even before he turn round I know who he be. Mr. Chichester! <now|instantly> I begin to make out the word. "All the same, it be dangerous. Suppose her friend <come|ejaculate> after her?" It be the <big|large> man <speak|address>. Chichester answer him. He have drop his clerical <voice|representative> entirely. No wonder I have not recognize it. "All bluff. They haven't an idea where she be." "She speak very positively." "I dare say. I've <look|wait> into the matter, and we've nothing to fear. Anyway, it's the 'Colonel's' order. You don't want to <go|get> against them, I suppose?" The Dutchman ejaculate something in his own language. I judge it to be a hasty disclaimer. "But why not knock her on the head?" he growl. "It would be simple. The boat be all ready. She could be take out to sea?" "Yes," say Chichester meditatively. "That be what I should do. She know too much, that be certain. But the 'Colonel' be a man who like to <play|run> a lone hand--though no one else must <do|come> so." Something in his own word seem to awaken a memory that annoy him. "He want <information|data> of some kind from this girl." He have pause before the information, and the Dutchman be quick to <catch|see> him up. "<information|data>?" "Something of the <kind|genial>." "Diamond," I say to myself. "And now," continue Chichester, "give me the <list|inclination>." For a long time their conversation <be|follow> quite incomprehensible to me. It seem to deal with large quantity of vegetable. Date be mention, price, and various <name|figure> of place which I do not <know|recognize>. It be quite half an hour before they have finish their check and count. "Good," say Chichester, and there be a <sound|fathom> a though he push back his chair. "I will take these with me for the 'Colonel' to see." "When <do|make> you leave?" "Ten o'clock to-morrow <morning|dawn> will do." "Do you want to see the <girl|fille> before you go?" "No. There be <strict|rigid> order that no one be to see her until the 'Colonel' come. Be she all right?" "I look in on her when I come in for dinner. She be asleep, I think. What about food?" "A <little|short> starvation will do no harm. The 'Colonel' will be here some time to-morrow. She will answer <question|doubt> <better|just> if she be hungry. No one have better go near her till then. Be she securely tie up?" The Dutchman laugh. "What <do|come> you think?" They both laugh. So do I, under my <breath|intimation>. Then, a the sound <seem|appear> to betoken that they be about to come out of the <room|board>, I beat a hasty retreat. I be just in time. A I reach the head of the stair, I hear the door of the <room|board> open, and at the same time the Kafir <stir|agitate> and move. My retreat by the way of the hall door <be|follow> not to be think of. I retire prudently to the attic, gather my bond round me and lay down again on the floor, in case they should take it into their head to come and look at me. They do not do so, however. After about an hour, I creep down the stair, but the Kafir by the door be awake and hum softly to himself. I be anxious to get out of the house, but I do not quite see how to manage it. In the end I be force to retreat to the attic again. The Kafir be clearly on guard for the <night|dark>. I remain there patiently all through the sound of <early|other> morning <preparation|provision>. The men breakfast in the hall, I could hear their voice distinctly float up the stair. I be get thoroughly unnerve. How on earth be I to get out of the house? I <counsel|advise> myself to be patient. A rash move might spoil everything. After breakfast come the sound of Chichester depart. To my intense relief, the Dutchman accompany him. I <wait|expect> breathlessly. Breakfast be <be|follow> <clear|open> <away|aside>, the work of the house be be do. At last, the various activity <seem|appear> to <die|go> down. I slip out from my lair once more. Very <carefully|cautiously> I creep down the stair. The <hall|residence> <be|follow> empty. Like a flash I be across it, have unlatched the door, and <be|follow> outside in the sunshine. I run down the drive like one posse. Once <outside|international>, I resume a normal walk. People star at me <curiously|peculiarly>, and I do not wonder. My face and clothe must have be cover in dust from roll <about|near> in the attic. At <last|live> I come to a garage. I go in. "I have meet with an <accident|stroke>," I explain. "I want a car to take me to Cape Town at once. I must catch the boat to Durban." I <have|take> not long to wait. Ten minute later I be speed along in the direction of Cape <town|township>. I must know if Chichester be on the boat. Whether to sail on her myself or not, I could not determine, but in the end I decide to do <so|therefore>. Chichester would not know that I have <see|ensure> him in the Villa at Muizenberg. He would doubtless lay further trap for me, but I be forewarn. And he be the man I be after, the man who be seek the diamond on behalf of the mysterious "Colonel." Ala, for my <plan|programme>! A I arrive at the dock, the _Kilmorden Castle_ be steam out to sea. And I have no mean of know whether Chichester <have|let> sail on her or not! I drive to the hotel. There be no <one|i> in the lounge that I know. I <run|go> upstairs and <tap|dab> on Suzanne's door. Her voice bid me "<come|get> in." When she <saw|consider> who it be she literally fell on my neck. "Anne, <dear|earnest>, where have you be? I've be worry to <death|decease> about you. What have you be do?" "Have <adventure|chance>," I reply. "Episode <III|TREY> of 'the Peril of Pamela.'" I tell her the whole story. She give <vent|air> to a <deep|mysterious> sigh when I finish. "Why do these thing <always|ever> happen to you?" she demand plaintively. "Why do no one gag me and bind me hand and foot?" "You wouldn't like it if they <do|come>," I assure her. "To tell you the truth, I'm not nearly so keen on have adventure myself a I be. A little of that sort of thing go a long way." Suzanne seem unconvinced. An hour or two of gag and bind would <have|let> change her view quickly enough. Suzanne like thrill, but she hat be uncomfortable. "And what be we all do now?" she <ask|expect>. "<I|SINGLE> don't quite <know|live>," I say thoughtfully. "You still go to Rhodesia, of course, to keep an eye on Pagett-- "And you?" That be just my difficulty. Have Chichester go on the _Kilmorden,_ or have he not? Do he mean to carry out his original plan of <go|move> to Durban? The hour of his leave Muizenberg seem to point to an affirmative answer to both <question|interrogate>. In that case, I might go to Durban by train. I fancy that I should get there before the boat. On the other hand, if the <news|word> of my <escape|leak> be wire to Chichester, and also the information that I have leave Cape Town for Durban, nothing be simpler for him than to leave the boat at either Port Elizabeth or East London and so give me the slip completely. It be rather a knotty problem. "We'll inquire about train to Durban anyway," I say. "And it's not too late for morning tea," say Suzanne. "We'll have it in the lounge." The <durban|Durban> train leave at 8.15 that even, so they tell me at the office. For the moment I postpone <decision|determination> and join Suzanne for <somewhat|fairly> belated "eleven-o'clock tea." "<do|come> you feel that you would really recognize Chichester again--in any other disguise, I mean?" ask Suzanne. I shake my head ruefully. "I certainly didn't recognize him a the stewardess, and never should have but for your draw." "The man's a professional actor, I'm sure of it," say Suzanne thoughtfully. "His make-up be perfectly <marvellous|wondrous>. He might come off the boat a a navvy or something, and you'd never <spot|recognize> him." "You're very cheer," I say. At that minute, Colonel Race step in through the window and come and join u. "What be Sir Eustace do?" ask Suzanne. "I haven't <see|consider> him <about|near> to-day." Rather an odd expression pas over the Colonel's face. "He's get a little trouble of his own to attend to which be keep him busy." "Tell u about it." "I mustn't tell tale out of school." "Tell u something--even if you have to invent it for our special <benefit|gain>." "<well|swell>, what would you say to the famous 'Man in the Brown Suit' have make the voyage with u?" _"What? "_ I felt the colour die out of my face and then <surge|soar> back again. Fortunately Colonel Race be not look at me. "It's a fact, I believe. Every port watch for him and he bamboozle Pedler into bring him out a his secretary!" "Not Mr. Pagett?" "Oh, not Pagett--the other fellow. Rayburn, he call himself." "<have|take> they arrest him?" ask Suzanne. Under the table she <give|leave> my hand a reassure squeeze. I wait breathlessly for an answer. "He seem to have disappear into thin air." "How do Sir Eustace take it?" "Regard it a a personal insult offer him by Fate." An opportunity of hear Sir Eustace's view on the matter present itself later in the day. We be awaken from a refresh afternoon nap by a page-boy with a note. In touch term it request the pleasure of our company at tea in his <sit|pose>-room. The poor man be indeed in a pitiable state. He pour out his <trouble|worry> to u, encourage by Suzanne's sympathetic murmur. (She do that sort of thing very well.) "First a perfectly strange woman have the impertinence to get herself murder in my house--on purpose to annoy me, I do believe. Why my house? Why, of all the house in Great Britain, choose the Mill House? What harm have I ever do the woman that she must need get herself murder there?" Suzanne make one of her sympathetic noise again and Sir Eustace proceed in a still more aggrieve tone. "And, if that's not enough, the fellow who <murder|remove> her have the impudence, the colossal impudence, to attach himself to me a my secretary. My secretary, if you please! I'm tire of secretary, I won't have any more secretary. Either they're <conceal|hide> murderer or else they're drunken brawler. Have you see Pagett's black eye? But of course you have. How can I <go|run> about with a secretary like that? And his face be such a nasty shade of yellow too--just the colour that doesn't go with a black eye. I've <do|come> with secretary--unless I have a girl. A nice girl, with liquid eye, who'll hold my hand when I'm feel cross. What about you, Miss Anne. Will you <take|make> on the <job|speculate>?" "How often shall I have to hold Harry keep him cover with the revolver. "So you see, Sir Eustace, the game be up. It be you yourself who very kindly provide u with the clue of your whereabouts. Race's men be <watch|see> the <exit|decease> of the secret passage. In spite of the precaution you take, they be successful in follow me here." Sir Eustace turn suddenly. "<very|really> clever. Very creditable. But I've <still|yet> a word to say. If I've lose the <trick|deception>, so <have|take> you. You'll never <be|follow> able to bring the murder of Nadina home to me. I be in Marlow on that <day|daylight>, that's all you've get against me. No one can prove that I even know the woman. But you know her, you <have|make> a motive for kill her--and your record's against you. You're a thief, remember, a thief. There's one thing you don't know, perhaps. _I've <get|let> the diamond._ And here go-- With an incredibly swift movement, he stoop, swing up his arm and throw. There be a tinkle of break glass, a the object go through the window and disappear into the blaze mass opposite. "There go your only hope of establish your innocence over the Kimberley affair. And now we'll talk. I'll drive a <bargain|deal> with you. You've get me corner. Race will find all he need in this house. There's a chance for me if I can get away. I'm do for if I stay, but so <be|follow> you, young man! There's a skylight in the next <room|way>. A couple of minutes' start and I shall be all <right|good>. I've <get|obtain> one or two little <arrangement|organisation> all ready make. You let me out that way, and give me a start--and I leave you a sign confession that I kill Nadina." _"Yes,_ Harry," I cry. "Yes, yes, yes!" He turn a stern face <on|along> me. "No, Anne, a thousand time, no. You don't know what you're say." "I do. It solve everything." "I'd never be able to look Race in the face again. I'll take my chance, but I'm damn if I'll let this slippery old fox get away. It's no <good|upright>, Anne. I won't do it." Sir Eustace chuckle. He accept defeat without the least emotion. "Well, well," he remark. "You seem to have meet your master, Anne. But I can assure you both that moral rectitude do not always pay." There <be|follow> a crash of rend wood, and footstep surge up the stair. Harry draw back the bolt. Colonel Race be the <first|low> to enter the room. His <face|case> light at the sight of u. "You're safe, Anne. I be afraid-- He turn to Sir Eustace. "I've be after you for a long time, Pedler--and at last I've <get|father> you." "Everybody seem to have go <completely|entirely> mad," <declare|hold> Sir Eustace airily. "These young people have be threaten me with revolver and accuse me of the most shock thing. I don't <know|recognize> what it's all about." "Don't you? It mean that I've find the 'Colonel.' It mean that on January 8th last you be not at Cannes, but at Marlow. It mean that when your tool, Madame Nadina, turn against you, you plan to do away with her--and at last we shall be able to bring the crime home to you." "<indeed|so>? And from whom do you get all this interest information? From the man who be even now be <look|see> for by the police? His <evidence|prove> will be very valuable." "We have other evidence. There be some one else who know that Nadina be go to meet you at the Mill House." Sir Eustace look surprise. Colonel Race make a gesture with his hand. Arthur Mink _alias_ the <rev|rpm>. Edward Chichester _alias_ Miss Pettigrew step forward. He be pale and nervous, but he speak <clearly|distinctly> enough: "I saw Nadina in Paris the night before she go over to England. I be pose at the time a a Russian Count. She tell me of her purpose. I warn her, know what kind of man she have to deal with, but she do not take my advice. There <be|follow> a wireless message <on|along> the <table|postpone>. I read it. Afterwards I think I would have a <try|effort> for the diamond myself. In <johannesburg|Johannesburg>, Mr. Rayburn accost me. He persuade me to come over to his side." Sir Eustace look at him. He say nothing, but Mink seem visibly to wilt. "Rat always leave a sink ship," observe Sir Eustace. "I don't care for rat. Sooner or later, I destroy vermin." "There's just one <thing|matter> I'd like to tell you, Sir Eustace," I remark. "That tin you throw out of the window didn't contain the diamond. It have common pebble in it. The diamond <be|follow> in a perfectly safe <place|rank>. A a matter of fact, they're in the big giraffe's stomach. Suzanne hollow it out, put the diamond in with cotton wool, so that they wouldn't rattle, and plug it up again." Sir Eustace look at me for some time. His reply be characteristic: "I always do hate that blink giraffe," he say. "It must have be instinct." We be not able to return to Johannesburg that night. The shell be come over pretty fast, and I gather that we be now more or le cut off, owe to the rebel have obtain possession of a new part of the suburb. Our <place|pose> of refuge be a farm some twenty mile or so from Johannesburg--right out on the veld. I be <drop|fell> with <fatigue|weariness>. All the excitement and anxiety of the last two day have leave me little better than a <limp|hobble> rag. I <keep|save> repeat to myself, without be <able|capable> to believe it, that our trouble be really over. Harry and I be together and we should never be separate again. Yet all through I be conscious of some barrier between u--a constraint on his part, the reason of which I could not fathom. Sir Eustace have <be|follow> drive off in an opposite <direction|focus> accompany by a strong guard. He wave his hand airily to u on <depart|part>. I come out on to the _stoep_ early on the follow morning and look across the veld in the <direction|management> of <johannesburg|Johannesburg>. I could see the great dump glisten in the pale morning <sunshine|sun>, and I could <hear|see> the low rumble mutter of the <gun|artillery>. The Revolution be not over yet. The farmer's wife come out and call me in to breakfast. She be a <kind|tolerant>, motherly soul, and I be already very <fond|warm> of her. Harry have go out at dawn and have not yet return, so she inform me. Again I felt a <stir|splash> of uneasiness pas over me. What be this shadow of which I be so conscious between u? After breakfast I sit out on the _stoep_, a book in my hand which I do not read. I be so lose in my own thought that I never saw Colonel Race ride up and dismount from his horse. It be not until he say "Good morning, Anne," that I <become|go> aware of his presence. "Oh," I say, with a flush, "it's you." "Yes. May I sit down?" He <draw|get> a chair up beside me. It be the first <time|clock> we have be alone together since that day at the Matoppos. A always, I felt that curious mixture of fascination and fear that he never fail to inspire in me. "What be the news?" I ask. "Smut will be in Johannesburg to-morrow. I <give|make> this outbreak three day more before it collapse utterly. In the meantime the <fight|agitate> go on." "I wish," I say, "that one could be sure that the right people be the one to get kill. I mean the one who want to fight--not <just|precisely> all the poor people who happen to live in the part where the fight be go <on|along>." He nod. "I know what you mean, Anne. That's the unfairness of war. But I've other news for you." "Yes?" "A confession of incompetency <on|along> my <part|split>. Pedler have manage to escape." "What?" "Yes. No one know how he <manage|do> it. He be securely lock up for the night--in an upper-story room of one of the farm roundabout which the Military have take over, but this <morning|dawn> the room be empty and the bird have fly." Secretly I be rather please. Never, to this day, have I be able to rid myself of a sneak fondness for Sir Eustace. I dare say it's reprehensible, but there it be. I admire him. He be a thorough-go villain, I dare say--but he <be|follow> a pleasant one. I've never <meet|see> any one half so amuse since. I conceal my feel, of course. Naturally Colonel Race would feel quite differently about it. He want Sir Eustace <bring|fetch> to justice. There be nothing very surprise in his escape when one come to think of it. All round Jo'burg he must <have|take> innumerable <spy|spot> and agent. And, whatever Colonel Race might think, I be exceedingly doubtful that they would ever catch him. He probably <have|get> a well-plan <line|air> of retreat. Indeed, he <have|make> say a much to u. I express myself suitably, though in a rather lukewarm manner, and the conversation languish. Then Colonel Race ask suddenly for Harry. I tell him that he <have|give> go off at dawn and that I hadn't see him this morning. "You <understand|see>, don't you, Anne, that apart from <formality|formalities>, he be completely clear? There be technicality, of course, but Sir Eustace's guilt <be|follow> well assure. There be nothing now to keep you apart." He say this without look at me, in a <slow|sluggish>, jerky voice. "I understand," I say gratefully. "And there be no reason why he should not at once resume his real name." "No, of course not." "You know his real name?" The question surprise me. "Of course I do. Harry Lucas." He do not answer, and something in the quality of his silence strike me a peculiar. "Anne, do you remember that, a we drive <home|habitation> from the Matoppos that <day|daylight>, I tell you that I know what I have to do?" "Of course I remember." "<I|SINGLE> think that I may fairly say I have do it. The man you love be clear of suspicion." "Be that what you mean?" "Of course." I <hang|cling> my head, ashamed of the baseless suspicion I have entertain. He speak again in a thoughtful <voice|representative>: "When I be a mere <youngster|minor>, I be in <love|bed> with a girl who jilt me. After that I think only of my work. My career <mean|tight> everything to me. <then|so> I meet you, Anne--and all that <seem|appear> worth nothing. But youth's call to youth. . . . I've still get my <work|mould>." I be silent. I suppose one can't really love two men at once--but you can feel like it. The magnetism of this man be very great. I look up at him <suddenly|abruptly>. "I think that you'll go very far," I say dreamily. "I <think|consider> that you've get a great career ahead of you. You'll be one of the world's big men." I felt a though I be utter a prophecy. "I shall be alone, though." "All the people who do <really|truly> big thing be." "You think so?" "I'm sure of it." He <take|have> my hand and say in a low voice: "I'd rather have have--the other." Then Harry come stride round the corner of the house. Colonel Race rise. "Good morning--Lucas," he say. For some reason <harry|beset> flush <up|upward> to the root of his hair. "Yes," I say gaily, "you must be know by your real name now." But Harry be still star at Colonel Race. "So you know, sir," he say at last. "I never forget a face. I saw you once a a boy." "What's all this about?" I <ask|take>, puzzle, look from one to the other. It <seem|appear> a conflict of will between them. <race|speed> win. Harry turn slightly away. "I suppose you're <right|good>, sir. Tell her my real name." "Anne, this isn't Harry Lucas. Harry Lucas <be|follow> kill in the War. This be John Harold Eardsley." With his last word Colonel <race|speed> <have|get> swing away and leave u. I stand star after him. Harry's voice <recall|remember> me to myself. "Anne, forgive me, say you forgive me." He take my hand in his and almost mechanically I draw it away. "Why do you deceive me?" "I don't know that I can make you understand. I be afraid of all that sort of thing--the power and fascination of wealth. I want you to care for me just for myself--for the man I be--without <ornament|embellish> and trapping." "You mean you didn't trust me?" "You can put it that way if you like, but it isn't quite true. I'd <become|get> embitter, suspicious--always prone to look for ulterior motif--and it <be|follow> so <wonderful|wondrous> to be care for in the way you care for me." "I see," I say slowly. I be go over in my own mind the <story|floor> he have tell me. For the first <time|clip> I note discrepancy in it which I <have|take> disregard--an assurance of money, the power to buy back the diamond of Nadina, the way in which he have prefer to speak of both men from the point of view of an outsider. And when he have say "my friend" he have mean, not Eardsley, but Lucas. It be Lucas, the quiet fellow, who <have|give> love Nadina so deeply. "How do it come about?" I <ask|involve>. "We be both reckless--anxious to get kill. One night we exchange identification disc--for luck! Lucas be kill the next day--blow to piece." I shudder. "But why didn't you tell me now? This morning? You couldn't have doubt my care for you by this time?" "Anne, I didn't want to spoil it all. I want to take you back to the island. What's the good of money? It can't buy happiness. We'd have be happy on the island. I tell you I'm afraid of that other <life|lifetime>--it nearly rot me through once." "Do Sir Eustace know who you <really|very> be?" "Oh, yes." "And Carton?" "No. He saw u both with Nadina at Kimberley one night, but he didn't know which be which. He <accept|assume> my <statement|command> that I be Lucas, and Nadina be deceive by his cable. She be never afraid of Lucas. He be a quiet chap--very deep. But I always <have|take> the devil's own temper. She'd have be scar out of her life if she'd know that I'd come to life again." "Harry, if Colonel Race hadn't tell me, what do you mean to do?" "Say nothing. Go on a Lucas." "And your father's million?" "Race be welcome to them. Anyway, he would <make|realize> a better use of them than I <ever|always> shall. Anne, what be you <think|believe> about? You're frown so." "I'm think," I say slowly, "that I <almost|nearly> wish Colonel Race hadn't make you tell me." "No. He be right. I owe you the truth." He pause, then say suddenly: "You know, Anne, I'm jealous of Race. He <love|know> you too--and he's a bigger man than I be or ever shall be." I turn to him, laugh. "Harry, you idiot. It's you I want--and that's all that <matter|weigh>." A soon a possible we start for <cape|mantle> Town. There Suzanne be wait to greet me, and we disembowel the <big|liberal> giraffe together. When the Revolution be finally quell, Colonel Race come down to Cape Town and at his suggestion the big villa at Muizenberg that <have|make> belong to Sir Lawrence Eardsley <be|follow> reopen and we all take up our abide in it. There we make our <plan|project>. I be to return to England with Suzanne and to <be|follow> marry from her house in London. And the trousseau be to be buy in Paris! Suzanne enjoy <plan|project> all these detail enormously. So do I. And yet the future seem curiously unreal. And sometimes, without know why, I <felt|find> absolutely stifle--a though I couldn't breathe. It be the night before we be to sail. I couldn't sleep. I be miserable, and I didn't <know|recognize> why. I hat leave Africa. When I come back to it, would it be the same thing? Would it ever be the same thing again? And then I be startle by an authoritative rap on the shutter. I spring up. Harry be on the _stoep_ outside. "Put some clothe on, Anne, and come out. I want to speak to you." I huddle on a few garment, and step out into the cool night air--still and scent, with it velvety feel. Harry beckon me out of earshot of the house. His face look pale and determine and his eye be blaze. "Anne, do you remember say to me once that woman enjoy do the thing they dislike for the sake of some one they like?" "Yes," I say, wonder what be come. He <catch|get> me in his arm. "Anne, <come|get> away with me--now--to-night. Back to Rhodesia--back to the island. I can't stand all this tomfoolery. I can't wait for you any longer." I disengage myself a <minute|narrow>. "And what about my French frock?" I <lament|lamentation> mockingly. To this day Harry never know when I'm in <earnest|solemn> and when I'm only <tease|ribbing> him. "Damn your French frock. Do you think I want to put frock on you? I'm a damn sight more likely to want to tear them off you. I'm not <go|run> to let you go, do you hear? You're my woman. If I let you go away, I may lose you. I'm never sure of you. You're come with me <now|instantly>--to-night--and damn everybody." He hold me to him, kiss me until I could hardly breathe. "I can't do without you any longer, Anne. I can't indeed. I hate all this money. Let Race have it. Come on. Let's go." "My toothbrush?" I demur. "You can buy one. I know I'm a lunatic, but for God's <sake|interest>, _come! "_ He stalk off at a furious <pace|footstep>. I follow him a meekly a the Barotsi woman I have observe at the Fall. Only I wasn't <carry|run> a fry-pan on my <head|brain>. He walk <so|then> fast that it be very difficult to keep up with him. "Harry," I say at last, in a meek voice, "be we go to walk all the way to Rhodesia?" He <turn|go> suddenly and with a great <shout|exclaim> of laughter gather me up in his arm. "I'm mad, sweetheart, I know it. But <I|SINGLE> do <love|know> you so." "We're a couple of lunatic. And, oh, Harry, you never ask me, but I'm not make a sacrifice at all! I _want_ to come!" That be two year ago. We still live on the island. Before me, on the rough wooden table, be the letter that Suzanne write me. Dear <babe|baby> in the Wood--<dear|good> Lunatic in Love, I'm not surprise--not at all. All the time we've be talk Paris and frock I felt that it wasn't a bite real--that you'd vanish into the <blue|aristocratic> some day to be marry over the tongs in the good old gipsy fashion. But you _be_ a <couple|pair> of lunatic! This idea of <renounce|vacate> a <vast|huge> fortune <be|follow> absurd. Colonel Race want to argue the <matter|subject>, but I have persuade him to leave the argument to time. He can administer the estate for <harry|beset>--and none better. Because, after all, honeymoon don't last forever--you're not here, Anne, so I can safely say that without have you fly out at me like a little wild-cat--Love in the wilderness will last a <good|safe> while, but one day you will <suddenly|abruptly> begin to dream of house in Park Lane, sumptuous fur, Paris frock, the largest thing in <motor|drive> and the latest <thing|affair> in perambulator, French <maid|housemaid> and Norland nurse! Oh, yes, you will! But have your honeymoon, dear lunatic, and let it <be|follow> a long one. And <think|remember> of me sometimes, <comfortably|well> put on weight amidst the fleshpots! Your love <friend|acquaintance>, Suzanne Blair. P.S.--I <be|follow> send you an assortment of fry-pan a a wed present, and an enormous _terrine_ of _pate de foie gras_ to remind you of me. There be another letter that I sometimes read. It come a <good|serious> while after the other and be <accompany|follow> by a bulky packet. It appear to be write from somewhere in Bolivia. My <dear|costly> Anne Beddingfeld, I can't resist <write|spell> to you, not so much for the pleasure it give me to write, a for the enormous pleasure I know it will give you to <hear|see> from me. Our <friend|champion> Race wasn't quite a clever a he think himself, be he? I think I shall appoint you my literary executor. I'm send you my diary. There's nothing in it that would <interest|concern> Race and his crowd, but I fancy that there be passage in it which may amuse you. Make use of it in <any|whatever> way you like. I suggest an article for the _Daily Budget,_ "Criminal I have meet." I only <stipulate|qualify> that I shall <be|follow> the central <figure|picture>. By this "Well, _mon ami_, a good deal you can guess for yourself. Of course you realize that, now Mr. Inglethorp be out of it, the whole position be greatly change. We be face to face with an <entirely|wholly> new problem. We know <now|instantly> that there be one person who do not buy the poison. We have clear away the <manufacture|cook_up> clue. Now for the real one. I have ascertain that anyone in the household, with the exception of Mr. Cavendish, who be play tennis with you, could have personate Mr. Inglethorp on Monday even. In the same way, we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall. No one <take|get> much notice of that at the inquest--but now it have a very different significance. We must find out who do take that coffee to Mr. Inglethorp eventually, or who pas through the hall whilst it be stand there. From your account, there be only two <people|mass> whom we can positively say do not go near the coffee--Mr. Cavendish, and Mademoiselle Cynthia." "Yes, that be <so|thus>." I felt an inexpressible lighten of the heart. Mary Cavendish could <certainly|surely> not rest under suspicion. "In clear Alfred Inglethorp," continue Poirot, "I have be oblige to show my hand sooner than I intend. A long a I might <be|follow> <think|remember> to be <pursue|follow> him, the criminal would be off his guard. <now|directly>, he <will|leave> be doubly careful. Yes--doubly careful." He turn to me abruptly. "Tell me, Hastings, you yourself--have you no <suspicion|hunch> of anybody?" I hesitate. To tell the truth, an idea, <wild|violent> and <extravagant|prodigal> in itself, have once or <twice|double> that morning <flash|dash> through my brain. I have reject it a absurd, nevertheless it persist. "You couldn't call it a suspicion," I murmur. "It's so <utterly|dead> foolish." "Come now," urge Poirot encouragingly. "Do not fear. Speak your mind. You should always <pay|give> attention to your instinct." "Well then," I blurt out, "it's <absurd|preposterous>--but I suspect Miss Howard of not <tell|say> all she know!" "Miss Howard?" "Yes--you'll laugh at me-- "Not at all. Why should I?" "I can't help feel," I <continue|keep> blunderingly; "that we've rather leave her out of the possible suspect, simply on the strength of her have be <away|aside> from the place. But, after all, she be only fifteen mile away. A car would do it in half an hour. Can we say positively that she <be|follow> away from Style on the night of the murder?" "Yes, my friend," say Poirot unexpectedly, "we can. One of my first action be to ring up the hospital where she be work." "Well?" "Well, I learn that <miss|lose> Howard have <be|follow> on afternoon duty <on|along> Tuesday, and that--a convoy come in unexpectedly--she have kindly offer to remain on night duty, which offer be gratefully accept. That dispose of that." "Oh!" I say, rather nonplus. "Really," I continue, "it's her extraordinary vehemence against Inglethorp that start me off suspect her. I can't help feel she'd do anything against him. And I have an idea she might know something about the <destroy|ruin> of the will. She might have burn the new one, mistake it for the <earlier|earliest> one in his favour. She be so terribly bitter against him." "You consider her vehemence unnatural?" "Y--e. She be so very violent. I wonder really whether she be quite sane on that point." Poirot shake his head energetically. "No, no, you <be|follow> on a wrong tack there. There be nothing weak-mind or <degenerate|degraded> about Miss <howard|Leslie_Howard>. She be an excellent specimen of well-balance English beef and brawn. She be sanity itself." "Yet her hatred of Inglethorp seem almost a mania. My idea be--a very ridiculous one, no doubt--that she have intend to poison him--and that, in some way, Mr. Inglethorp get <hold|admit> of it by mistake. But I don't at all see how it could have be do. The whole thing be <absurd|ridiculous> and ridiculous to the last degree." "Still you be <right|rectify> in one thing. It be always wise to suspect everybody until you can <prove|establish> logically, and to your own <satisfaction|atonement>, that they be innocent. Now, what reason be there against Miss Howard's have deliberately poison Mr. Inglethorp?" "Why, she be devote to her!" I <exclaim|outcry>. "Tcha! Tcha!" cry Poirot irritably. "You argue like a child. If Miss Howard be capable of poison the old lady, she would be <quite|rather> equally capable of simulate devotion. No, we must look elsewhere. You be perfectly correct in your <assumption|premise> that her <vehemence|wildness> against Alfred Inglethorp be too violent to be natural; but you be <quite|rather> wrong in the deduction you draw from it. I have draw my own deduction, which I believe to be correct, but I will not speak of them at present." He pause a minute, then go on. "Now, to my way of think, there be one insuperable objection to Miss Howard's be the murder." "And that be?" "That in no possible way could Mr. Inglethorp's death benefit Miss Howard. Now there be no murder without a <motive|motif>." I reflect. "Could not Mr. Inglethorp have make a will in her favour?" Poirot shake his head. "But you yourself suggest that possibility to Mr. Well?" Poirot smile. "That be for a reason. I do not want to mention the name of the person who be actually in my mind. Miss Howard occupy very <much|practically> the same position, so I use her name instead." "Still, Mr. Inglethorp might have <do|make> so. Why, that will, make on the afternoon of her death may-- But Poirot's shake of the head be so energetic that I stop. "No, my friend. I have certain <little|small> <idea|mind> of my own about that will. But I can <tell|say> you this much--it be not in Miss Howard's favour." I accept his <assurance|pledge>, though I do not really see how he could be so positive about the matter. "Well," I say, with a sigh, "we will acquit Miss Howard, then. It be partly your <fault|break> that I ever come to suspect her. It be what you say <about|around> her evidence at the inquest that set me off." Poirot <look|reckon> puzzle. "What do I say <about|around> her evidence at the inquest?" "Don't you remember? When <I|SINGLE> cite her and John Cavendish a be above suspicion?" "Oh--ah--yes." He seem a little confuse, but recover himself. "By the way, Hastings, there be something I want you to do for me." "<certainly|surely>. What be it?" "Next time you happen to be alone with Lawrence <cavendish|Henry_Cavendish>, I want you to say this to him. 'I have a message for you, from Poirot. He say: "Find the <extra|superfluous> coffee-cup, and you can <rest|repose> in peace!"' <nothing|nil> more. Nothing le." "'Find the extra coffee-cup, and you can rest in peace.' Be that right?" I <ask|take>, much <mystify|stick>. "<excellent|splendid>." "But what do it mean?" "Ah, that I will leave you to find out. You <have|get> access to the fact. Just say that to him, and see what he say." "Very well--but it's all extremely mysterious." We be <run|go> into Tadminster now, and Poirot direct the car to the "Analytical Chemist." Poirot hop down briskly, and go inside. In a few minute he <be|follow> back again. "There," he say. "That be all my business." "What be you do there?" I ask, in lively curiosity. "I leave something to be analyse." "Yes, but what?" "The <sample|taste> of cocoa I take from the saucepan in the bedroom." "But that have already be test!" I cry, stupefy. "Dr. Bauerstein have it test, and you yourself laugh at the possibility of there be strychnine in it." "I know Dr. Bauerstein <have|let> it test," reply Poirot quietly. "Well, <then|so>?" "Well, I have a <fancy|project> for have it analyse again, that be all." And not another word on the subject could I drag out of him. This proceed of Poirot's, in respect of the cocoa, puzzle me intensely. I could see neither rhyme nor reason in it. However, my confidence in him, which at one time have <rather|quite> wan, be fully restore since his belief in Alfred Inglethorp's innocence have be <so|therefore> triumphantly vindicate. The funeral of Mr. Inglethorp take place the follow day, and on Monday, a I come down to a late breakfast, <john|trick> draw me aside, and inform me that Mr. Inglethorp be leave that morning, to take up his quarter at the Stylite Arm until he should have complete his plan. "And really it's a <great|big> relief to think he's <go|fling>, Hastings," continue my honest <friend|acquaintance>. "It be bad enough before, when we <think|believe> he'd do it, but I'm hang if it isn't worse now, when we all feel guilty for have be so down on the fellow. The fact be, we've treat him abominably. Of course, thing <do|come> look black against him. I don't see how anyone could blame u for jump to the conclusion we do. Still, there it be, we be in the wrong, and <now|directly> there's a beastly feel that one ought to make <amend|repair>; which be difficult, when one doesn't like the fellow a bite better than one do before. The whole thing's damn awkward! And I'm thankful he's <have|get> the tact to take himself off. It's a good thing Style wasn't the mater's to leave to him. Couldn't bear to think of the fellow lord it here. He's welcome to her money." "You'll be able to keep up the place all right?" I ask. "Oh, yes. There be the <death|destruction> duty, of course, but half my father's money go with the place, and Lawrence will stay with u for the present, so there be his share a well. We shall be pinch at first, of course, because, a I once tell you, I be in a bite of a hole financially myself. Still, the Johnny will wait now." In the general relief at Inglethorp's approach departure, we have the most <genial|amiable> breakfast we have experience since the tragedy. Cynthia, whose young spirit be naturally buoyant, be look quite her pretty self again, and we all, with the <exception|exclusion> of Lawrence, who seem unalterably gloomy and nervous, be quietly cheerful, at the open of a new and hopeful future. The <paper|composition>, of course, have be full of the <tragedy|catastrophe>. Glare headline, sandwich biography of every member of the household, subtle innuendo, the usual familiar tag about the police have a clue. Nothing be spar u. It be a slack time. The war be <momentarily|momently> inactive, and the <newspaper|paper> <seize|attach> with avidity on this <crime|offence> in fashionable life: "The Mysterious Affair at Style" be the topic of the moment. Naturally it be very annoy for the Cavendish. The house be constantly besiege by reporter, who be consistently deny admission, but who continue to haunt the village and the ground, where they lay in wait with camera, for any unwary member of the household. We all live in a blast of publicity. The Scotland Yard men come and go, examine, question, lynx-eye and reserve of tongue. Towards what end they be work, we do not know. Have they any clue, or would the whole <thing|affair> remain in the category of undiscovered crime? After breakfast, Dorcas come up to me <rather|quite> mysteriously, and ask if she might have a few <word|intelligence> with me. "Certainly. What be it, Dorcas?" "Well, it's just this, sir. You'll be see the Belgian gentleman to-day perhaps?" I nod. "Well, sir, you know how he <ask|expect> me so particular if the mistress, or anyone else, have a green <dress|decorate>?" "Yes, yes. You have find one?" My interest be arouse. "No, not that, sir. But since then I've remember what the young gentleman"--John and Lawrence be still the "young gentleman" to Dorcas call the 'dress-up box.' It's up in the front attic, sir. A great chest, full of old clothe and fancy dress, and what not. And it come to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them. So, if you'd tell the Belgian gentleman-- "I will tell him, Dorcas," I promise. "Thank you very much, sir. A very nice gentleman he <be|follow>, sir. And quite a different class from them two detective from London, what go pry about, and ask question. I don't hold with foreigner a a rule, but from what the newspaper say I make out a how these brave Belges isn't the ordinary run of foreigner, and certainly he's a most polite speak gentleman." <dear|darling> old Dorcas! A she stand there, with her honest face upturned to mine, I think what a fine specimen she be of the old-fashion servant that be so fast die out. I think I might a well go down to the village at once, and look up Poirot; but <I|SINGLE> meet him half-way, come up to the <house|mansion>, and at once <give|make> him Dorcas's message. "Ah, the <brave|weather> Dorcas! We will look at the chest, although--but no matter--we <will|leave> examine it all the same." We enter the house by one of the window. There be no one in the hall, and we go <straight|directly> up to the attic. <sure|certain> enough, there be the chest, a fine old <piece|man>, all stud with brass nail, and full to overflow with every imaginable type of garment. Poirot bundle everything out on the <floor|dump> with <scant|short> ceremony. There be one or two green fabric of vary shade; but Poirot shake his <head|principal> over them all. He seem somewhat apathetic in the search, a though he expect no great result from it. Suddenly he give an exclamation. "What be it?" "Look!" The chest be nearly empty, and there, repose right at the bottom, be a magnificent black beard. "_Oho!_" say Poirot. "_Oho!_" He turn it over in his hand, examine it closely. "New," he remark. "Yes, quite new." After a moment's hesitation, he replace it in the chest, heap all the other thing on top of it a before, and make his way briskly downstairs. He go straight to the pantry, where we find Dorcas busily polish her silver. Poirot wish her <good|respectable> morning with Gallic <politeness|niceness>, and go on: "We have be look through that chest, Dorcas. I <be|follow> much oblige to you for mention it. There be, <indeed|so>, a fine collection there. Be they often use, may I ask?" "Well, sir, not very often nowadays, though from time to <time|clock> we do have what the <young|new> gentleman call 'a dress-up night.' And very funny it be sometimes, sir. Mr. Lawrence, he's wonderful. <most|nearly> comic! I shall never forget the night he come down a the Char of <persia|Persia>, I think he call it--a sort of Eastern <king|magnate> it be. He <have|get> the big <paper|report> knife in his <hand|script>, and 'Mind, Dorcas,' he say, 'you'll have to <be|follow> very respectful. This be my specially sharpen scimitar, and it's off with your head if I'm at all displease with you!' <miss|lose> Cynthia, she be what they call an Apache, or some such <name|discover>--a Frenchify sort of cut-throat, I <take|assume> it to <be|follow>. A real <sight|view> she look. You'd never have believe a pretty young lady like that could have make herself into such a ruffian. Nobody would have know her." "These even must <have|get> be great fun," say Poirot genially. "I suppose Mr. Lawrence wear that fine black beard in the chest upstairs, when he be Shah of Persia?" "He do have a beard, sir," reply Dorcas, smile. "And well I know it, for he borrow two skein of my black wool to make it with! And I'm sure it look wonderfully natural at a distance. I didn't know a there <be|follow> a beard up there at all. It must have be get quite lately, I think. There be a red wig, I know, but nothing else in the way of hair. <burn|sting> cork they <use|apply> mostly--though 'tis messy <get|let> it off again. Miss Cynthia be a nigger <once|formerly>, and, oh, the trouble she have." "So Dorcas know nothing about that black beard," say Poirot thoughtfully, a we walk out into the <hall|mansion> again. "Do you <think|consider> it be _the_ one?" I whisper eagerly. Poirot nod. "I do. You notice it have be trim?" "No." "Yes. It be cut exactly the shape of Mr. Inglethorp's, and I find one or two snip hair. <hastings|Thomas_Hastings>, this affair be very deep." "Who put it in the chest, I wonder?" "Someone with a good deal of intelligence," remark Poirot dryly. "You <realize|recognize> that he choose the one place in the house to hide it where it <presence|front> would not be remark? Yes, he be intelligent. But we must be more <intelligent|healthy>. We must be so <intelligent|healthy> that he do not suspect u of be intelligent at all." I acquiesce. "There, _mon ami_, you <will|leave> be of <great|big> assistance to me." I be please with the compliment. There have be time when I hardly think that Poirot appreciate me at my true worth. "Yes," he continue, star at me thoughtfully, "you will be invaluable." This be naturally gratify, but Poirot's next <word|intelligence> be not so welcome. "I must <have|make> an ally in the house," he observe reflectively. "You have me," <I|SINGLE> protest. "True, but you be not sufficient." I be hurt, and <show|establish> it. Poirot <hurry|speed> to explain himself. "You do not quite take my mean. You be know to be work with me. I want somebody who be not associate with u in any way." "Oh, I see. How about John?" "No, I think not." "The dear fellow isn't perhaps very bright," I say thoughtfully. "Here come Miss Howard," say Poirot suddenly. "She be the very person. But I be in her black book, since I clear Mr. Inglethorp. Still, we can but try." With a nod that be barely civil, Miss Howard assent to Poirot's request for a few minutes' conversation. We go into the little <morning|aurora>-room, and Poirot close the door. "Well, Monsieur Poirot," say Miss Howard impatiently, "what be it? Out with it. I'm busy." "Do you remember, mademoiselle, that I once ask you to help me?" "Yes, I do." The lady nod. "And I <tell|say> you I'd help you with <pleasure|delight>--to <hang|cling> Alfred Inglethorp." "Ah!" Poirot study her seriously. "Miss <howard|Howard>, I will ask you one question. I beg of you to reply to it truthfully." "Never tell lie," reply Miss Howard. "It be this. <do|answer> you <still|however> believe that Mr. Inglethorp be poison by her husband?" "What do you mean?" she ask sharply. "You needn't think your pretty <explanation|account> influence me in the <slightest|little>. I'll admit that it wasn't he who buy strychnine at the chemist's shop. What of that? I dare say he soak <fly|wing> paper, a I tell you at the begin." "That be arsenic--not strychnine," say Poirot mildly. "What <do|make> that matter? Arsenic would put poor Emily out of the way <just|precisely> a well a strychnine. If I'm <convince|convert> he do it, it doesn't matter a <jot|tinge> to me _how_ he do it." "<exactly|precisely>. _If_ you <be|follow> convince he do it," say Poirot quietly. "I <will|leave> put my question in another <form|work>. Do you ever in your heart of heart believe that Mr. Inglethorp be poison by her husband?" "Good heaven!" cry Miss Howard. "Haven't I always tell you the man be a villain? Haven't I always tell you he would murder her in her bed? Haven't I always hat him like poison?" "Exactly," say Poirot. "That bear out my little idea entirely." "What little idea?" "Miss Howard, do you remember a conversation that take place on the day of my friend's <arrival|comer> here? He repeat it to me, and there be a sentence of yours that have impress me very much. <do|make> you remember affirm that if a crime have be commit, and anyone you love <have|let> be murder, you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal be, even if you be quite unable to prove it?" "Yes, I remember say that. I believe it too. <I|SINGLE> <suppose|theorize> you think it nonsense?" "Not at all." "And yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against Alfred Inglethorp." "No," say Poirot <curtly|shortly>. "Because your instinct be not against Mr. Inglethorp." "What?" "No. You wish to <believe|consider> he commit the crime. You believe him capable of commit it. But your instinct <tell|distinguish> you he do not commit it. It <tell|say> you more--shall I go on?" She be star at him, fascinate, and make a <slight|little> affirmative movement of the hand. "Shall I tell you why you have be so vehement against Mr. Inglethorp? It be because you have be try to believe what you wish to believe. It be because you be try to drown and stifle your instinct, which tell you another name-- "No, no, no!" cry Miss Howard wildly, fling up her hand. "Don't say it! Oh, don't say it! It isn't true! It can't be true. I don't know what put such a wild--such a dreadful--<idea|estimate> into my head!" "I be <right|powerful>, be <I|SINGLE> not?" ask Poirot. "Yes, yes; you must be a wizard to
